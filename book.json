      "here is the text to use as the base for all the answers: EP1: Concussion 101 w/ Dr. Robert Cantu and George Abunaw\n\nHello and welcome to the first episode of Concussion Game Plan, a podcast from the Concussion Legacy Foundation. I'm your host Dr. Chris Nowinski, co-founder and CEO of the Concussion Legacy Foundation. We are here because more than 5 million Americans suffer concussions each year. If you or your loved one has just suffered a concussion, what you do next can make the difference between a fast recovery and a long fight. I know this because I made the wrong choices after a concussion in 2003 and I've paid the price ever since. We created the Concussion Game Plan to give you all the information you need to set yourself up for a complete recovery, but also to be prepared for the challenges you may face. We're glad you found us. Our hope is this podcast will help guide you through the first days and weeks of concussion recovery and beyond. We want you to know when to seek care, what to expect, and most of all, that you are not alone. Over the course of the next eight episodes, you'll hear from the leading experts in the field along with patients who have suffered concussions to validate your experience, share coping tips, offer advice for caregivers, and support you through the recovery process. Today, we're taking a deep dive on the injury itself. What's really happening in your brain when you have a concussion? What should you do in the first 48 hours after injury? Let's jump right in.\n\nA concussion is a type of traumatic brain injury, and it's usually caused by a very violent shaking of the brain inside the skull. Most of the time there's a blow to the head that's received that causes this shaking, but sometimes there isn't a blow and it's simply a whiplash type shaking of the head from a blow to another part of the body. Dr. Robert Cantu is one of the world's leading experts on concussion. He was also my doctor when I was desperately trying to understand why a concussion I suffered in 2003 as a WWE professional wrestler would not go away. Dr. Cantu diagnosed me with post-concussion syndrome and helped me realize that in 18 years of banging my head in sports, I had never been taught the science and symptoms of a concussion or the value of resting after a concussion. I soon learned that I was not alone. Few athletes have ever been properly educated on concussions. Dr. Cantu opened my eyes to an enormous public health issue. So we founded the nonprofit Concussion Legacy Foundation together in 2007 to change how concussions were understood and managed. Dr. Cantu still serves as CLF's medical director and also sees patients at the Cantu Concussion Center at Emerson Hospital in Concord, Massachusetts. There's no one better equipped to take us inside the brain during concussion. What's happening in the brain itself is really two things. First, and probably the most prominent, is a metabolic aberration so that brain cells can't talk to each other, can't function the way they normally do, because the transmitters that they use to talk to each other are chaotically released and are not present to be transmitted in a normal way. And then there are also metabolic changes within cells that cause the individual cells themselves not to function normally. And we refer to that as the neuro metabolic cascade of concussion. And that's certainly the most prominent thing in immediate concussion. But there is also a second injury, and the second injury is something that is more extreme in some cases than others, and it involves an actual structural tearing of axons, the connection between nerve cells, and sometimes a tearing of nerve cells themselves. And when there is a prominent amount of structural damage, then the symptoms almost always last a very long time and sometimes, rarely, but sometimes don't completely recover.\n\nYour brain controls well, everything. So it makes sense that a concussion can impact how a person thinks, feels, and acts. The most common immediate symptoms of concussion fall into the cognitive group of symptoms such as memory, such as learning new things, such as memory for what had happened at the time of the concussion and in the seconds and minutes after the concussion. So cognitive issues are quite immediate. Also physical symptoms, or what we call also somatic symptoms happen immediately. The most common of them is headache and that is the most common symptom of concussion and it is almost always occurring rather rapidly after the blow to the head. Other common symptoms that can occur frequently right after a concussion are dizziness or lightheadedness, or being aware that one's balance is off, or being aware that one's vision is off. There are other symptoms that can occur fairly rapidly, but usually occur days or sometimes several days after a concussion. And these symptoms fall into the sleep category, especially the difficulties with sleeping less than usual and the difficulty with falling asleep at night. It was just the headaches, just not being like 100%, I would say, and the sun seemed like just incredibly bright for no reason.\n\nGeorge Abood, a former member of Boston University's Men's Soccer team recalls how he felt after a concussion he suffered during his sophomore year. I always just seemed to have a pressure in my head with, you know, any activity I did. There was like a little man inside my head and he was just like pushing on the inside. And like sometimes he wouldn't push hard, sometimes he would push hard, sometimes when he was pushing at all. Like I I know for a fact I wouldn't be able to watch a movie or even like a 30-minute TV show. Like I wasn't watching Netflix or anything because I just couldn't focus on it. George, like so many others, didn't immediately recognize or respond to his concussion. It was on a Friday and I was playing at an indoor soccer tournament at my old club team, and I was actually supposed to go back to school that Saturday, so literally the next day, and it was indoor, so there's boards all around. And I was dribbling down and I got fouled and when I fell, I hit my head on the board and I could kind of hear everyone gasp and say, like you know, like that. And I just remember getting back up. I don't remember like how long I was down, but I walked off and everyone looked incredibly concerned and I just remember telling them like, I'm I'm fine. And then like probably after 5 minutes, I went back on, kept playing. I finished up and scored. Then the next game I scored a hat trick and like even on the car car ride home, I remember telling my mom and my brother like, I don't know why everyone was overreacting like I feel perfectly fine. And then probably that night as I was about to go to bed, I just got a horrible headache.\n\nIf you think you've suffered a concussion, the most important thing is to immediately restrict physical and cognitive activity. Uh if you're a distance from home, uh don't drive your car home. You don't want to physically or cognitively stress yourself immediately after a concussion. What's happening over the first 48 hours especially, but it actually can go beyond 48 hours and does in many cases, is the brain is trying to repair itself. This ATP pump is trying to put the sodium and potassium ions that have exited the nerve cells into the spaces outside of nerve cells back into nerve cells so that the nerve cell can now function again. And the neurotransmitters, which have been chaotically released from the ends of axons, uh that talk to adjacent nerve cells, can be put back on the ends of axons so that one cell can now communicate with the other. So there's a storm of activity, it requires energy. Unfortunately, the pump is damaged by the uh depolarization of membranes of the cells that happen and allowing for ions that don't normally uh occupy intracellular spaces to now occupy them like calcium, which shuts down the pump. But what's happening is this reparative process, and that's why rest both cognitive and physical is so important immediately after a concussion, especially in the first 48 to 72 hours. Looking back on it, George told us he wishes he would have rested more immediately after he hit his head. But he soon received a clue from his Xbox that he needed to take action. As silly as it sounds, I actually um decided to go get checked out the next day because I was playing FIFA, like the video game, the soccer video game and uh I'm a very good FIFA player and I've always been the best out of all my friends, and I played against um we had a kid who had just transferred and he's actually one of my best friends now, but I didn't know him at the time, and he said, oh, like, I'm a great FIFA player. And I was like, I'm the best around. So he plays me and I lose to him and that was strange. I was like, okay, I never lose. Like this is weird. Then I played another one of my roommates who I've never lost to, lost to him twice. And I was like, okay, this is this is strange, like why is my brain not working well? For me it was one of those things where I was like, okay, I can't hide from it anymore. I can't keep telling myself, I'm fine. Clearly, you know, something's happening where my brain isn't fully functioning. My eyes aren't fully functioning. I'm not at full capacity because if I was at full capacity, this would never happen. So I decided immediately to go to the urgent care and it was at that urgent care that I was officially diagnosed with a concussion. Certainly not all concussions do you have to see a doctor immediately. If the symptoms are relatively few, we normally track um in our concussion checklist 26 symptoms. Uh say you only had a few of them, four or five of them and they weren't very severe, we normally score them from one to six in terms of severity. Um and say most of the symptoms were relatively mild, I don't think in in most of those instances you need to see a doctor right away. But if the symptoms get worse over time, especially rapidly get worse, or if the symptoms persist for a period of more than days or weeks, then for sure you should be seeing a doctor. I think the safe thing is any symptoms of any significant severity that persist more than a few days, uh I would certainly suggest uh a doctor be consulted or at least a concussion specialist. I think athletes are a little bit different because you now have the return to sport issue. It's very important after a concussion that if you're an athlete, uh that you've been seen by a doctor or a member of the medical team before you go back to play. Anybody with concussion symptoms should not be making their own diagnosis and in terms of when they should return to play. They should be seen and evaluated by a medical specialist with concussion expertise. Whether or not you see a doctor right away, it's important to listen to your body and be in tune with your symptoms before returning back to work or school. For someone that's had a concussion, um you don't want to go back to work with its cognitive and some kinds of work, physical demands, or even go back to school with its cognitive demands, if you're significantly symptomatic. It's much better to take a day or two off and see if the symptoms won't on their own subside. If they won't subside, then you should be seeking medical attention. If you do elect to go back to school and you find that your symptoms are exacerbated by returning to school or returning to work, then you should seriously think about uh again going back home and getting a doctor's note to stay out of school or stay out of work.\n\nEP2: Physical Symptoms of Concussion Pt. 1 w/ Dr. David Dodick and Carla Ciccone\n\nComing up on this episode of the Concussion Game Plan Podcast, you can imagine that the inflammation that occurs in the meninges after a concussion can activate these pain sensitive nerve endings, just like that.\nHey everyone, it's Dr. Chris Nowinski, co-founder and CEO of the Concussion Legacy Foundation.\nWelcome to Episode 2 of the Concussion Game Plan Podcast.\nWe created Concussion Game Plan to give you the information you need to set yourself up for a complete recovery, but also to prepare you and your loved ones for the challenges that you may face.\nToday, we're bringing you Part One of our two-part series focusing on the physical symptoms of concussion.\nThink headaches, dizziness, nausea, light and noise sensitivity and issues with sleep.\nWe want to help you understand why you or a loved one may be feeling the way you do and what you can do to feel better.\nMost of all, we want you to know you're not alone.\nFirst of all, headache is the most common symptom after concussion.\nDr. David Dodick is professor of neurology at the Mayo clinic in Scottsdale Arizona.\nHe also directs the concussion clinic there and co-chairs the American Academy of Neurology’s Concussion Committee.\nAt least 90% of people who are concussed will have a headache, and oftentimes it will be immediate.\nSometimes it can be delayed, like many concussion symptoms that can evolve over the hours to days after a concussion.\nNow, why it happens from a biological standpoint, we, we don't really know.\nHowever, you can't have headache without activating what we call the trigeminal sensory system.\nSo there's a nerve called the trigeminal nerve, and this trigeminal nerve sends millions and billions of little nerve endings into these pain sensitive areas.\nAnd we know that these pain sensitive areas are injured during a concussion.\nThe first thing that's injured is the capsule over the brain, what we call the meninges, and the meninges, sort of like the skin of an apple.\nYou know, if the brain's an apple, the skin on the apple are the meninges, and the meninges are one of the most pain sensitive structures in the human body.\nAnd we know that there's intense inflammation within the meninges and some very soon after a concussion.\nSo you can imagine that the inflammation that occurs in the meninges after a concussion can activate these pain sensitive nerve endings, just like that, and you get a, you get a headache.\nWhen these nerve endings are activated, they too release substances from the nerve endings that further activate those nerve endings.\nSo it's kind of a vicious cycle.\nAnd if that's allowed to progress, then the headache becomes entrenched, and it can stay for days or weeks or months.\nSo that's one mechanism whereby headache can occur.\nThe other mechanism, of course, is that we have an area in our brains that where the trigeminal nerve comes into the brainstem.\nIt's kind of grand central and pain signals are sent up from grand central to the cortex where it's registered as pain.\nNormally grand central, there's a brake on it.\nIt's inhibited, right?\nOtherwise, we'd always have headache.\nWhat happens is that inhibition or that brake is lifted after a traumatic brain injury, because all of those descending fibers in the brain that come down, that keep a break, that keep the pedal to the metal and keep the brake on that grand central from firing, is all of a sudden lifted.\nAnd so that's another mechanism whereby headache occurs.\nSo you have a lot of traffic coming in from activated trigeminal nerves, and you've lifted the brake, which allows those signals just to, to propagate up and be registered as pain.\nLike Dr. Dodick said, headaches after concussion are often immediate, but they are a symptom someone is feeling and not a sign anyone else can see.\nFor Toronto based writer Carla Cicconi, they were a pain she initially tried to hide.\nSo, at first I was kind of like, oh, it's fine, you know, like, as my headache's just getting worse and worse and I'm getting blurry vision and I'm, I'm confused, and I'm trying to be like, oh, it's fine.\nAnd, and the people across from me saw and heard the impact, and they're like, are you sure?\nBecause that was like, we heard that.\nCarla looks back now at the concussion that changed her life nearly a decade ago.\nBut I happened to be sitting down at a restaurant.\nI, it was celebrating like a friend of a friend's birthday and we were all eating out and it was the end of the meal, we'd all had dessert.\nEverything was wrapping up, and all of a sudden I felt this huge, it felt like a brick got thrown at the back of my head, and kind of went down and like, I wasn't completely knocked out.\nI was, I was seeing stars and like, kind of like a cartoon character might, but I turned around and there was just a bus boy with a stack of plates and he felt so bad for hitting me.\nI didn't want to make a big deal of it.\nSo I was like, please don't call an ambulance, and that night I didn't go to the hospital or the doctor.\nI went home and went to bed, which probably wasn't the best idea in hindsight, but I really didn't know that I had a concussion.\nIt wasn't until the next morning I woke up with the worst headache I've ever had and experiencing a lot of typical concussion symptoms like blurred vision and, um, vertigo and I, um, couldn't look at my, any screen for even like a minute, and being a freelance writer that's it prevented me from doing my job.\nThe headaches were pretty constant.\nThey were kind of localized I got hit in the back of my head, so it was a pain that started in the back of my head, but kind of went all the way around.\nUm, and I did take, um, pain medica I took Advil constantly, but it didn't actually make a too much of a difference.\nMost of the time, doctors don't end up treating post concussion headache because for about 70% of concussed individuals, the headache goes away within a week or so.\nBut in some cases, Dr. Dodick believes it's best to treat the headache aggressively.\nNumber one, you don't want people in pain, and number two, while we can't necessarily predict who's going to go on to develop persistent post-traumatic headache, we know some risk factors for that, but not all, we want to make sure that the brain doesn't get used to processing pain, because once it gets used to processing pain, it may just continue to process pain.\nI happen to be in the school of thought where we treat headache and we treat it aggressively, because if, if I treat it aggressively upfront, and that might prevent some people from going on to have it persist.\nYou know, some of the medications that we use early on, are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\nWhy?\nBecause they're effective in relieving pain, because they may reduce or suppress the inflammation that occurs after concussion.\nAnd as long as the individual doesn't have any evidence of bleeding, which the overwhelming majority of people with mild traumatic brain injury or concussion do not, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are safe.\nA bad headache can make it very difficult to get through school or work, making it easy for practical worries and stress to seep in.\nIt was kind of like immediate for me that got into a dark place mentally and emotionally because I suffer with depression and anxiety anyway, and so it just kind of made everything so much worse, because I had none of the usual supports that I I normally rely on.\nI couldn't go outside and go for a walk.\nI couldn't, you know, I couldn't watch TV.\nI couldn't work, which was a big one, because I was losing income.\nSo the worry of like not being able to bring in money was, was a big one.\nIt's quite stressful and and you know, anxiety provoking to have your life completely turned upside down.\nMeditation, biofeedback, relaxation therapy, all of these things can be helpful, not just for the headache, but for other symptoms that, you know, athletes and other people experience during that post-concussion phase.\nBeyond headache, dizziness, nausea, and balance problems are very common symptoms after concussion.\nFor Carla, even walking around her apartment was difficult.\nI had, um, in the weeks right after the concussion, uh, persistent headaches, nausea for sure.\nUm, I had vertigo really bad.\nI couldn't walk straight for a long time.\nUm, I had really bad eye strain which kind of goes hand in hand with the headaches.\nI stayed in my apartment and didn't really venture out very much and I, I had to rely on like holding onto walls and stuff to, to get, make it to my kitchen, and make it to the bathroom, because it was just kind of, everything was kind of spinny and I was wobbly.\nFor those of you who have been dizzy, you'll realize that it often comes with nausea and you often feel, you know, off balance.\nSo that's why this is kind of a constellation of symptoms that cluster together.\nBut dizziness itself can be due to a couple of different things.\nFirst of all, vision is impaired after concussion.\nSo we know that the majority of the pathways in the brain are actually dedicated to vision and to the control of your eye movements.\nAnd because that's often impaired after a concussion, if what you're seeing is not registering appropriately in your brain, um, that can cause a sensation of disequilibrium or feeling off balance.\nAnd because the oculomotor system as we call it, or the system that governs or manages eye movements and vision is intimately hooked up to what we call the vestibular system, the system that maintains balance, there's, there's a mismatch of what's coming in from our ears and feet, and what's coming in to our eyes and that can create the sensation of dizziness.\nThe other problem is that sometimes the inner ear organs that, we call them, we call it the vestibular apparatus or the vestibular system, can be damaged from a head impact.\nSo, when people have vestibular dysfunction that leads to dizziness and unsteadiness, it can be due to damage to the vestibular organs themselves, outside of the brain, and because we're dealing with a traumatic brain injury, it could actually be due to problems inside of the brain.\nSo it's what we call peripheral versus central vestibular dysfunction.\nEither way, it's damaging in some way or impairing or disrupting the normal control over the vestibular system, and that can lead to dizziness.\nThe other thing that can lead to dizziness is what we refer to as autonomic dysfunction.\nSo autonomic dysfunction is pretty common after a concussion.\nWhat is autonomic dysfunction?\nI like to tell people that the autonomic nervous system is like the automatic nervous system.\nWe have a nervous system, a parallel nervous system if you will, that controls things which are normally involuntary: blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, motility of your gut.\nWe don't control these things.\nThey're controlled basically for us.\nAnd it so happens that after a concussion, a very common problem is, um, a problem with this autonomic nervous system.\nSo very labile or fluctuating blood pressure, heart rate, and that can cause dizziness.\nSo one of the first questions I ask people is when I'm taking a history about dizziness, I say to the person, is the dizziness like a light headedness that comes when you stand up or when you sit up?\nBecause that could be not due to damage to the vestibular system.\nIt could be due to dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, which is a completely different animal, that requires a completely different treatment approach.\nSo, it's important to sort of dissect out when someone says dizziness, they could be meaning any one of a number of things, and it's important to generate a differential diagnosis and to determine exactly where that dizziness is coming from, because that's going to determine how you're going to manage that.\nBecause this vestibular system is linked up with another area in the brain that can lead to nausea, that's where the nausea and the and the sometimes vomiting comes from.\nSo sometimes, you know, the brain is a complex network and things are interconnected.\nSo if something goes wrong with one area of the brain, it can cause problems in another.\nAnd that's why nausea is such a common symptom in people who have dizziness, because the areas of the brain that are responsible for dizziness are inextricably linked to areas of the brain that control, you know, that are responsible for generating nausea and sometimes vomiting.\nThe other thing I will say is that nausea can come also as a manifestation of headache.\nSo, you know, if you have moderate to severe headache, you're probably more likely to be nauseated.\nSo recognize the fact that nausea can come from different sources.\nAnd I guess the final thing I will say regarding dizziness, is you have to assess the neck.\nSometimes people who are concussed may have had a whiplash injury as well.\nAnd we have this nervous system called the vestibulo spinal system, whereby, you know, nerves in the neck hook up with this vestibular system that I talked about, and so just a whiplash injury of the neck and problems with the neck, can actually cause dizziness.\nDizziness and nausea can be very difficult to deal with day to day.\nBut the good news is, there are treatments available.\nSo, some of the treatments that people may take advantage of if they're suffering from dizziness and balance problems, is once we figured out where the problem is coming from, if it's coming from the visual and oculomotor system, for example, then sometimes vision therapy, or, you know, eye exercises can be helpful.\nSo we call it, you know, oculomotor integration, convergence therapy.\nSo sometimes vision therapy, it's all clumped under vision therapy, can be helpful.\nIf there's, if the problem is coming from, from the visual system.\nUm, sometimes physical therapy and treatment for that is directed towards the neck can be helpful, and then sometimes, you know, we take advantage of some of the physical therapists that we have who do vestibular therapy.\nSo, exercises to sort of facilitate the ability of the vestibular system to adapt to the injury and to recover from the injury.\nIf you take away anything from this episode, I hope it will be that symptoms you may be experiencing are real, your pain is valid, and there are treatments that can help you feel better.\nIf you're looking for help, finding a provider like Dr. Dodick, who can prescribe those treatments, reach out to the CLF helpline.\nOur staff provide free, personalized support to those struggling with brain injury symptoms.\nWe'll help connect you to care and resources in your area.\nYou can submit a request for yourself or a loved one at concussionfoundation.org/helpline.\nThat's a wrap on Part One of our conversation with Dr. David Dodick and Carla Cicconi.\nA special thanks to both of them for joining us.\nBe sure to tune in to Part Two where we'll cover symptoms like blurry vision, light and noise sensitivity and difficulty sleeping.\nPlus, Carla has excellent advice on how to stay positive throughout recovery.\nNormal life will resume, it might look a little bit different, but you'll get there and just be patient with yourself and go really easy on yourself.\nUntil then, I'm Dr. Chris Nowinski.\nKeep fighting.\n\nEP3: Physical Symptoms of Concussion Pt. 2 w/ Dr. David Dodick and Carla Ciccone\n\nHello, it's Dr. Chris Nowinski, co-founder and CEO of the Concussion Legacy Foundation. Welcome to episode three of the Concussion Game Plan podcast and part two of our conversation with Dr. David Dodick and Carla Ciaccone focused on the physical symptoms of concussion. We want to jump back in starting with a look at visual symptoms after concussion. We know visual impairment and dysfunction is common after concussion, and symptoms can be painful and disorienting.\nIt was the type of feeling where, like, if you looked at your computer screen for like 48 hours straight without stopping, and you got like the worst eye strain of your life, just your eyes are exhausted. You know, they all you want to do is shut them for a little bit of relief and you can't. That it just and it felt like there's like a headache in your eyes, like in the back of your eyes.\nA headache in the back of your eyes is a great way of describing it. Carla Ciaccone is a Toronto based writer who suffered a concussion after a waiter carrying a tray of plates slammed into the back of her head at a restaurant. Dr. David Dodick, a professor of neurology who runs the Concussion Clinic at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona tells us patients often report having blurred vision and trouble focusing.\nWhen they say, I can't, I can't sit in a car, because as things start going by me, I get dizzy, that could be a visual problem. Or they say, you know, when I walk down a grocery aisle, I get dizzy and disoriented, that could be a visual problem. And then sometimes they just can't quite track things in their visual world. So that's something they complain about. Sometimes they complain of actual frank double vision, where they see two things either side by side or two things you know, on top of one another. That's not terribly common, but but it can occur. So it's important when someone says, there's something wrong with my vision to figure out exactly again, what it is they mean by that, because the treatment for it is going to depend on where the problem is. You know, the thing about concussion is that it's an injury that can affect different areas of the brain in different people. And the thing about vision and the thing about ocular motility, and the fact that we take for granted when I look up, look down, look side to side, I don't even think about that because it happens so easily and spontaneously. But that's very complicated anatomy. And the anatomy of vision and the anatomy of eye movements is distributed throughout the brain. And what I mean by that is, at least half of the brain's pathways, and we're talking about 200 billion cells, each of which make 10,000 connections to 10,000 other cells. It's really complicated. But more than half of those brain pathways are dedicated to vision and eye movement. That's profound. What that means is that it's almost impossible to place an injury in anyone location of the brain or brainstem without affecting vision and eye movements. And that's why vision is so commonly affected after concussion.\nTo treat these complex vision symptoms, it's important to find the right type of specialist.\nThe help that you need may come not even from necessarily an eye doctor. I mean, it's obvious to think that if I have a problem with my vision, I'm going to go to an eye doctor. But when you go to an eye doctor, they do what they do and they do it very well, and they they look in the back of your eyes and they see that the eye itself looks healthy. And your vision looks your visual acuity looks normal. You got 2020 vision and your eyes look healthy. That doesn't solve the problem. And so you really need to be seen by either a neuro ophthalmologist who has expertise in this area, or a concussion program where they have therapists and experts in the the you know, the vision and ocular motor system who can initiate exercises. Sometimes they'll put prisms in your lenses and things like that. So sometimes there are techniques and tricks like that that they can use. But oftentimes it comes down to training the visual system to adapt to the injury and to overcome. And in the vast majority of cases, that happens. It may not happen overnight, but it happens over days or weeks. But usually, the the visual symptom is something that's you can rehabilitate. But it's it's you have to pressure test the system by doing certain exercises and visual therapies that actually enhances and facilitates and speeds up that adaptation that would normally occur in the brain anyway. You're just trying to to move it along. Sometimes these visual exercises and visual therapies are not fun because they can cause you to be dizzy. They can make your headache worse. They can cause you to feel nauseated and imbalance. And it's like, wow, I feel 10 times worse after doing that. But it it is important to sort of push through it, because you force your brain to adapt to the injury. And not to the point where you're debilitated by your symptoms, but it's perseverance and persistence is important. So, recognize the fact that you might feel a little bit worse when you first start out start out with some of these visual exercises and visual therapies, but know that, you know, relief is around the corner. Your brain will adapt and you will recover and improve from this.\nFor Carla, recovery was all about learning the balance of positively stimulating her brain without pushing things too hard or putting too much pressure on herself.\nThere were days that I tried to just go back to my normal routine or go back to working on my computer because I just it was that's what I do and I I just really wanted to to get better and and you you want to test the waters of how bad am I? Like, let me just see. And when I did that, it does just set you back so much farther. You I would wake up the next day or even just immediately like have to go lay down because I had made my headache that much worse by staring at a screen. And I'm admittedly not a sporty person, but definitely if I um pushed my body beyond its its limits, you know, you you I got a physical reminder right away of why I was supposed to be resting. You know, headaches got worse, vision got blurrier, and it just it it makes your recovery that much longer. And I think that was a scary part for me because I noticed right away when I would try to push myself that that I would get that much worse right after.\nI wish I would have known that it's okay. It's okay to not feel okay and it's okay to not know exactly when this this is going to wrap up and I'm and I'm going to feel better again or back to my old self. And that it's a process. Like it's a it's a process of talking about what's going on, more than you're probably comfortable with. I know you're supposed to be able to tell your doctors anything or you technically you should, but sometimes it's not comfortable to tell your doctor, you know, my concussion has made my thoughts turn dark and and I'm really depressed. And those things don't don't come naturally to us sometimes. So I would have told myself to just relax about that. Talk to as many people as possible, advocate for yourself and just be patient with yourself, and go really easy on yourself. Treat yourself like you would treat like a little baby that you were taking care of, and pretend that you are that little baby. It's like it's a weird way to think of it, but really like when you're when your brain gets hurt, you're kind of back to square one and you really need to nurture yourself as much as you can.\nBeing kind and understanding with yourself throughout the healing process is key. And for parents and caregivers, your love, support, and compassion can have a direct impact on how your loved one recovers.\nIf I'm if I'm talking to a parent or someone who's supporting someone with concussion. First of all, it's an understanding and an empathy that this is real. It's biology, not psychology. And although you can't see it, feel it or touch it, what they're telling you and what their experience is absolutely real. And it's not due to, you know, stress or anxiety or some other psychological problem that this is often attributed to. This is a traumatic brain injury. And many of the symptoms that people experience including anxiety and depression are related to the injury itself. To some extent, from the devastation that devastating impact that it has had on their life, but also as a manifestation, as a symptomatic manifestation of the disease of the injury itself. So empathy and understanding that what they're telling you is absolutely real. Number two, don't accept any explanation to the contrary. So if you're seeing a healthcare provider who tries to chalk this up to just stress or depression or some other mood disorder, don't accept it. Find somebody who has expertise, who understands the injury, and is used to looking after people who have post-concussion symptoms. So, find the right person and don't give up until you've found the right person or the right team to care for you, because the the better and the more aggressively this is this is managed up front, the less likely it is that you're going to be susceptible to the next one, and the less likely it is that your life is going to be impacted long term from this. So, help them find the help that they need. And and don't accept no for an answer and don't if it doesn't sound right to you, listen to your gut instinct, listen to yourself.\nGreat message there from Dr. Dodick. We'll be right back.\nIf you need help finding the right doctor or the right team to treat your concussion and post-concussion syndrome, we're here for you. The CLF helpline provides free, personalized support to those struggling with the outcomes of brain injury. The helpline also has a mentorship program that connects those suffering with a peer support volunteer who has had similar experiences as a patient or caregiver. Submit a request today at concussionfoundation.org/helpline and a dedicated member of the Concussion Legacy Foundation team will be in touch with you as soon as possible.\nTwo of the most common concussion symptoms we haven't touched on yet are the ones that make it hardest to live a normal life after concussion, light and noise sensitivity.\nSo imagine if you were being interrogated and someone was just, you know, how obnoxious it is and offensive it is to have a light shine in your eyes, you immediately want to move away, right? And avoid that. Imagine if you were in a car, and you had a really good sound system and you just cranked it up to the very, you know, as high as it could go. You can't take that for very long, right? So it's like, you know, the volume of both sound and light has been turned up significantly even though nobody's adjusted the light and nobody's adjusted the noise. So that's what sound and light sensitivity can feel like for people. And you can imagine if someone's having both light and sound sensitivity, it's hard to be in the world, right? Because there are lights everywhere and there is sound everywhere. And so you want to just there's a reason why people retreat to a quote quiet, dark room, because the light and sound is so, not only obnoxious, but actually it exacerbates all the other symptoms. So exposure to light and sound, not only is offensive, but it amplifies the headache, it amplifies the dizziness and it amplifies the nausea, and it amplifies the imbalance. And why is that? Because the brain is so interconnected. We have what we call sensory integration centers in the brain. So if I have pain in my head, whether it's from a head injury or I have a migraine headache, or I have meningitis, or I've just had a ruptured aneurism, the first thing that's going to happen is I'm going to have severe pain in my head. The next thing that's going to happen is I'm going to be sensitive to light and sound, and I'm going to be nauseated. Why? These networks are interconnected. And once you once you upset one area in the brain, immediately it's talking to other areas in the brain. So, when you have pain in your brain, the first thing it starts doing is it starts talking to all these sensory integration networks so that normal movement becomes is perceived as unsteadiness. Normal light is perceived as a spotlight in the eye, and normal sound is perceived as like a gunshot. Everything is louder, um noisier, brighter. Even smells can be more offensive, right? I can smell something 10 miles away. The sensory environment is turned up. And it's very hard to function in in a world like that. It's due to the functional connectivity between these areas of the brain. Sometimes wearing sunglasses can help. Sometimes there are special type of lenses. They're called FL41 lenses that can actually filter out the most offensive spectrums of light in the light spectrum. So it might it might filter out red light or yellow light or white light, for example. Often times treating headache can actually make sound and light sensitivity much better. So if I treat headache, and I treat the visual system, and I treat the vestibular system effectively, then all of a sudden, all the other symptoms start to die down and dampen and down, right? So light is now less offensive, and and sound the light and sound sensitivity isn't as prominent. So, trying to avoid situations where there's bright light and sound, maybe using certain types of lenses that can help. But ultimately, it's treating the other problems. It's very seldom do I see people who just come in and say, doc, I can't stand the light. That's the only problem I have is I just can't stand the light. It's never like that.\nThe last physical symptom we'll touch on today is sleep. Concussion can affect our sleep in many ways.\nSome people become what we call hypersomnolent. They always want to sleep. They can't get enough sleep. Other people can't get to sleep, so they become, you know, insomniacs. So sleep disruption is common and it can be different in different individuals. It occurs because the anatomy that controls sleep and the the biochemistry in the brain that controls sleep is tightly regulated. And if you disrupt those areas, if you disrupt brain chemistry and if you disrupt disrupt the anatomy of the brain, you can obviously disrupt the normal circadian rhythms and the normal anatomy and biochemistry that controls sleep wake cycles. So that's that's why it occurs. And some of the areas of the brain that are affected by concussion happen to be areas that are intimately involved in the control and regulation of sleep wake cycles.\nThe first thing that people can do about it is to try to avoid factors that can amplify the the problem. So, if you're having trouble getting to sleep and staying asleep, then, you know, avoiding things like a lot of caffeine can can be helpful. Taking things that are relatively natural that can help you sleep, like melatonin, for example, could be helpful. Melatonin is something that's gotten a lot of interest recently because it has anti-inflammatory properties, and it seems perhaps maybe neuro protective after concussion and it helps sleep. So melatonin could could be helpful as a over-the-counter preparation that could actually help you sleep. The other thing is that all of these other symptoms that you're experiencing could be making it difficult for you to sleep. So headache for example. If you have a severe headache and you're nauseated, it's very difficult to sleep. It's difficult to get to sleep, it's difficult to stay asleep. So managing these other symptoms can be can be effective in helping you get to sleep and stay asleep.\nKeeping regular sleep wake schedules. Yeah, it's very tempting uh to have a nap today. But, you know, I'm going to try to stay awake and go to bed and try to wake up at the same times even though that may be difficult. Um, it's I think it's important. So sleep hygiene. That type of sleep hygiene approach is important.\nCaregivers who know their loved one is struggling with sleep can play an important role in making sure they practice good sleep hygiene.\nEncouragement. You know, encouragement. If if people do the sorts of things that I said, and, you know, when you go into the bedroom, um there's no cell phone, there's no laptop, there's no computer, there's no television. So you're in bed to sleep. You maintain normal sleep and wake cycles. You avoid things that can make it worse like caffeine, uh late night snacks, things like that. You take, you know, supplemental melatonin or things like that that can help with sleep, you manage other symptoms. I think it's just again, just an awareness that the right environment is necessary to help someone sleep. Relaxation therapy, stress management. These things are also helpful for sleep. Cognitive behavioral therapy. So all of these things if if you write down the list and keep continue to try to encourage, because sometimes if you have a high school son or daughter at home and, you know, they're used to going to bed late, waking up late, they've got their phone in bed with them, they're snacking in bed, they're talking to their friends or texting their friends. All of these things, while it seems like that they're going to do more of that if they can't get to sleep, it becomes paramount to stop that for a period of time until you re-establish some normality and you get over that period of acute post-concussion symptoms. I guess if I were a parent, I would say, look, it's short term pain for long term gain here, yeah? You we can't continue to operate like you've been before you were concussed. So, for the next two to three weeks, we have to strict to the schedule because then you can get back to your normal life. But if we don't, this can linger and can persist and make like much more difficult long term. So short term short term pain for long term gain.\nWe like to end each episode with a big dose of hope. If you're listening right now and struggling with any of the symptoms we've touched on today or others, please know that you will get better and you are not alone. Carla recommends doing everything you can to find community.\nWhen you're dealing with the symptoms of a concussion and you're alone, being alone with your thoughts and headaches and whatever else you're experiencing can really get you to a dark place rather quickly, and it's really important to seek help from your community, from your doctors, from from whoever you can, because having having other people around is really what what helped me. And um advocating for myself to my doctors. I was very hesitant to to do anything. I it took me getting to a very, very low point to even seek out treatment at all. But it really was for me making tiny baby steps and doing new things in a in a safe and slow way that kind of that led to me eventually starting to heal and get better. And a big, big part of that was was talking to people, talking to different doctors, talking to friends. Even I talked to a couple of strangers who had been through concussions before, just just to open yourself up as much as you can, not in, you know, it's scary at first, but to try to to do it and try to find safe spaces, doctors that you feel comfortable with, people that you know well, or that come recommended, so that it's can take some of the pressure off. But I think definitely seeking help and in community is even if you're an introvert, I'm a I'm an introvert by nature, and it did help me more than probably anything, because there's only so much you can do for yourself by yourself. I'm here to tell you that it does get better, just get through the day, do what you need to do to get to relax and get through each day.\nFor Dr. Dodick, it's all about the three P's. Patience, perseverance and positivity. Patience that you wish this would just go away tomorrow, but it may not. This is an injury that may take a little time to recover. And it's different for everybody. So your friend might have gotten over their concussion in two days. Two weeks down the road, you're still experiencing symptoms. It's different for everybody. So you need to have some patience. You need to be positive in that the vast majority of people get better. And then perseverance. And by that I mean, you have to stick with what's been recommended, but you also have to persevere in finding the right provider or the right care team. And that is crucial because it's difficult for people to get better on their own if they're not provided with the education, the support and the right sort of treatment approaches that's tailored specifically to their individual needs. And if you're not getting the respect and support and care that you think you should be getting, then you have to move on. You have to persevere. You have to find the right team and there are there are really excellent providers out there.\nA big thank you to Dr. David Dodick and Carla Ciaccone for joining us for both of our physical symptom episodes and thank you for listening in.

Coming up on episode four.\nWhen you have a concussion all of a sudden you have very low levels of uh what feels like cognitive stamina then everything can really uh become an issue in terms of not being able to handle or cope with situations. The amazing Dr. Christina Master joins us to break down the emotional symptoms of concussion and explain why mental health issues like the depression Carla touched on in today's episode, are common after concussion. Until then, I'm Dr. Chris Nowinski. Keep fighting.\n\nEP4: Emotial Symptoms of Concussion w/ Dr. Christina Master and Noah Abrams\n\nComing up on this episode of the Concussion Game Plan podcast.\ndepressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms are something that we absolutely see kids experiencing, people experiencing after concussion.\nHey everyone, it's Dr. Chris Nowinski, co-founder and CEO of the Concussion Legacy Foundation.\nWelcome to episode four of the Concussion Game Plan podcast.\nI can't wait for you to hear our conversation with Dr. Christina Master explaining the emotional symptoms of concussion.\nWhat they are, why they happen, and how they are treated.\nYou'll also hear from a former division one soccer player who struggled emotionally after his concussion.\nHe joins us to share what helped him most along the way.\nHere on Concussion Game Plan, we want to give you the information you need to set yourself up for a complete recovery, but also to prepare you and your loved ones for the challenges you may face.\nMost of all, we want you to know that you're not alone.\nLet's dive right in.\nAnd just a producer's note, Noah's recording took place while he was on the sidelines of an early morning soccer practice.\nSo just a heads up that there are extra background noises in his interview.\nWe apologize if you find them distracting.\nHere is Dr. Master.\nPeople commonly will think about depression or anxiety as being symptoms that you can experience after concussion.\nBut in younger kids, we actually often will see um, you know, a whole wide range that can be kids acting silly, kids acting uh very, you know, frustrated easily and having irritability.\nDr. Christina Master is a professor of clinical pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania, Perlman School of Medicine.\nAnd the co-director of the Minds Matter Concussion Program at Children's Hospital Philadelphia.\nShe's the only pediatric sports medicine specialist with a sub-specialty in brain injury medicine in her region, and the perfect person to walk us through the emotional symptoms of concussion.\nThe depression and anxiety sometimes can be related to the situation where they're not involved in the school and activities that they're usually used to being involved in.\nBut we do think that there is also a very much just a biological injury component that just causes you to have a biological experience of depression and anxiety.\nSo it can really run the entire range in terms of emotionality, and probably liability is um, one of the main characteristics of all of them, that uh no matter which emotional symptom you're experiencing, it can be a little bit of a rollercoaster experience.\nIf you feel like your emotions are all over the place after a concussion, that rollercoaster experience Dr. Master describes, you're not alone.\nKnow that it's normal to be feeling a little unstable.\nYour brain stamina and your brain energy is really not what it's usually um at.\nteenagers, kids usually are like energizer bunnies, and they have loads of brain energy, brain uh stamina, uh cognitive stamina.\nAnd so when you have a concussion all of a sudden, you have very low levels of uh what feels like cognitive stamina, then everything can really uh become an issue in terms of not being able to handle or cope with situations.\nAnd so, being able to be on an emotion emotional even keel, um may be very challenging.\nIt takes a lot of cognitive energy that you just all of a sudden don't have.\nAnd so then um issues like depression or anxiety can set in.\nCertainly, you know, frustration and inability to cope with stress, you know, are related to um those cognitive stamina issues, and really the cognitive stamina translates into emotional stamina essentially.\nAnd so if you think about it developmentally, even from an early childhood standpoint, you know, what kids are doing in their preschool years is learning how to control their temper and their feelings um and have a little bit of self-control for that.\nUm, and that requires energy, both cognitive energy, as well as emotional energy, and if that is all of a sudden lower after concussion, um that's definitely I think contributing to why emotional symptoms occur.\nWe do think that there is a biological reason too that we just don't understand yet entirely in terms of what happens after the injury, and the biochemical changes that happen in your brain.\nAnd the best way I could kind of describe the anxiety also with the uh with the physical symptoms of headaches and pain is was just feeling like you're in an overdrive mode where like where your hardware is just like out of memory.\nThat's kind of how I felt.\nAt the end of the day, or like 3 or 4 o'clock came and my my headache and my physical symptoms were so so high, I felt like my brain was going to explode, but I also had this this overwhelming anxiety and like pit in my stomach into my chest, that it literally felt like my whole body and my mind was in this overdrive mode where like my computer was about to crash.\nNoah Abrams was playing in goal for the Northeastern University Men's soccer team during a September 2018 game, when he collided with an attacker's knee.\nHe was knocked unconscious and rushed to the hospital, where doctors put 18 staples in the side of his head.\nIn the weeks that followed, he struggled with increased sadness, anxiety, and irritability.\nI would say in general, not a very irritable guy.\nLike a go with the flow kind of dude.\nAt least that's what I think, maybe my friends or family wouldn't describe me as that.\nBut I remember being in class probably a little bit too soon after my concussion, probably two or three weeks.\nUm, and when people used to open their food containers, whether it was like wrappers or sandwiches in class, that used to always frustrate the hell out of me.\nUm, like just hearing the sound, and I would always think, why can't why can't you just open that faster?\nOr, why do you have to open that right now?\nSo I remember those little things used to really frustrate me.\nAnd even sometimes like the clicking of the remote, or the closing of cabinets, when I got home, I I remember I kind of flipped the switch a couple of times at my mom because I felt like she was closing the trash can too loud.\nUm, and obviously looking back at it, she she wasn't at all, but just the sound of the trash can like closing every single time throughout the day used to bother me so much.\nSo I would say, yeah, it was definitely an irritable thing, but it was also a combination of the emotions and the physical symptoms.\nI would say, kind of, that's when the concussion recovery gets really, really hard is when your emotional symptoms and physical symptoms kind of start to collide with each other.\nSometimes after a concussion, you know you feel off emotionally, but aren't able to put into words what has changed about you.\nTo be honest, I think one of the most enlightening things that one of my patients told me, um, was a 10-year-old little girl.\nAnd you'll be surprised, many many people may be surprised that we screen every child in our practice, um for depression or anxiety.\nSo, when I asked a 10-year-old if she felt sad or worried, or down or depressed, she kind of looked at her mom, um, like was it okay for her to tell me?\nAnd her mom said, \"Go ahead and tell Dr. Master\".\nAnd she said, \"I'm sad and I don't know why\".\nAnd it was interesting to me because I really felt like that kind of captured that biological depression aspect because I think we often, as, you know, adults, teenagers will attribute the fact that we feel sad because of a reason, right?\nWe feel sad because we had a concussion, we're not doing our things, we are anxious because we're worried or we're stressed.\nBut, you know, there is absolutely, you know, a biological component to this.\nYou know, we are biological beings, and so I think that there is that biochemical aspect.\nI obviously felt very emotional, anxious and depressed from the kind of traumatic experience, but also there was certain times even in that moment I couldn't directly pinpoint or point out why I was feeling sad.\nI just had this like overwhelming amount of sadness and tears, and I it was very uncontrollable.\nLike I couldn't, it just came and went whenever and I couldn't like decide and hold it in.\nReally from that moment on, my emotions really always got the best of me and they just kind of just came and went at the most random times.\nI asked Dr. Master why some people experience emotional symptoms following a concussion, while others do not.\nThat is a really, really great question.\nI think that we only have a partial answer to that with all the research that's been done.\nI think that there is a lot that people have um, you know, been looking at in terms of, you know, if you have a pre-existing condition like depression or anxiety before you have a concussion, or even a learning disability or attention deficit, you know, disorder.\nYou know, that may get worse after a concussion.\nAnd so that kind of makes sense to folks that that could happen.\nBut that's not 100% the case to be quite honest.\nUm and so I would say it's just, you know, as frequent, um, you know, anecdotally in our practice and certainly if you look at the literature out there, the data is very conflicting that it's not a 100% slam dunk that just because you have depression and anxiety before concussion does not mean that you're going to have it worse after a concussion.\nBecause you didn't have it before, um does it mean that you're going to be immune to it?\nAnd so, I do think that it's really important, you know, because um mental health carries so much stigma still in our culture that it's really important to de-stigmatize it and normalize it as a part of this experience of injury with concussion.\nAnd so, it's nobody's fault that you're having, you know, emotional symptoms.\nUm it's not, you know, a weakness.\nIt just is what it is, and then we have to address it.\nAnd I think, from the standpoint of kids who have pre-existing um depression or anxiety, if they are in treatment, in therapy, you know, on or not on medications, uh the fact that they are aware of the fact that they have depression and anxiety and have some skills to cope with it, sometimes makes them better equipped to handle depression and and anxiety after concussion.\nWhereas it's our kids who have never dealt with depression and anxiety before a concussion that all of a sudden experience it with a concussion and really haven't had to develop any skills to manage that.\nAnd so, it can kind of cut the opposite way sometimes with that.\nSo, I think that it ends up being um very much an interplay between the kind of injury that you had.\nIt's not necessarily, um, you know, an indication that you have a more severe, you know, mechanism of injury or a more severe force per se.\nThat may be the case in some instances.\nBut, um, I think from that standpoint, there's some combination of the way the injury interacts with the individual and their genetic background that they come to the injury with, and then how that all interacts that we still haven't really been able to tease out, but definitely some people struggle more and we just don't 100% know why.\nIf you are experiencing emotional symptoms after a concussion or caring for someone who is, it's important you prepare for those symptoms to stick around longer than just a few days.\nWhen I was young we thought everybody got better in a couple days, right?\nUm, and there's no big deal.\nAnd there probably are still a subset of people who do get better very quickly, and there probably is something biological about that.\nBut I think, you know, with the research that's being done now, I think everyone pretty much accepts that for children at least, children into adolescence, and probably, you know, even into like the college years, it may take up to four weeks to fully get 100%, you know, or feeling like you're back to where you were before the injury.\nYou know, it's a gradual process.\nYou're not, you know, you're not in the pits the entire time the whole four weeks.\nYou're making progress, you know, every day during those four weeks.\nBut you know, if you're really honest with yourself and if we're honest with ourselves, probably takes about a month to fully get better.\nAnd and that would include I think the emotional symptoms as well for sort of, you know, typical, quote unquote, average, you know, concussions.\nUm I think a month is a reasonable time frame.\nWhen you think about it, a month is actually a long time, right?\nI mean it's a long time in the life of a teenager.\nYou know, I mean, in some sports, it's like half season, you know?\nAnd so I think from that standpoint, I think it's really important like you said to set the stage and set the expectation that everybody wants to be better in a few days, and only a few lucky people probably are for, you know, reasons that have nothing to do with anything that they're doing, it's just how they were made, you know?\nAnd so I think from that standpoint, to set the to set the um expectation that it may take normally a month, and that if you're in the 20 to 30%, it looks like, where you might have longer symptoms, it might take a couple of months or more.\nYou know?\nAnd so, that kind of at least gets you in sort of like more of the marathon mode, or at least you know the middle distance half marathon mode, as opposed to the 5K mode, you know, where you're just doing your turkey trot and then you're done.\nAnd so, I think that's really important for for families to know because I think parents may come in with that expectation having grown up with this concept that concussions are done and better in a couple of days.\nNoah says it wasn't until he recognized his recovery would be unpredictable, and take longer than a few days that he could start to heal.\nI always said that my concussion like rehab process only really began when I accepted that my season was over and that was probably about three weeks after my concussion.\nBecause at that point, I was just thinking like, okay my my symptoms are getting better, like I'm going to be back on the field in this date, this date, this date.\nAnd I remember looking at the calendar and the college soccer season so short and looking at myself and being like, I want to do what's best for my health, and there's no way that I'm going to get back in time and a safe manner.\nSo I think you just have to one look out for yourself first, and two, at least for me, like I accepted that my season was over and then it was it was a really, really hard decision because I was like, well there's no way that I can come back in in time.\nBut as soon as I did that, I felt like my, at least for me, my recovery really started.\nIt's obviously with a concussion, it's so hard because there's no flexibility test.\nThere isn't a certain amount of weight you have to lift or a certain amount of miles you have to run before you can be back on the roster.\nIt's it's really up to you, and like in your mind like you you can't decide it.\nThere's nothing you can do.\nIt's just whether whether or not you you're feeling back to yourself.\nSo on the outside it's definitely a really, really hard thing to go through because like I said, there's there's no x-ray.\nThere's no MRI.\nIt's just kind of you know when you when you're ready.\nAnd so it's obviously really, really frustrating.\nBut for me, I never I never risked it, I never um tried to come back too soon.\nSo my biggest advice to to anyone out there is if if you've learned anything about concussions it's it's don't rush the process because if you think you're ready but you're not quite sure, you're probably not ready yet.\nYou'll you'll know to some extent when when your symptoms have kind of settled down.\nFor any athlete out there, it's it's definitely a really hard thing.\nThe competitive drive to get back on the field, but you should definitely worry about your your health first, and understand that it's your brain.\nIt's not your calf.\nIt's not your foot.\nIt's your brain that we're talking about.\nVery wise advice there from Noah.\nI was so naive when I had suffered the concussion that ended my wrestling career 18 years ago.\nI treated my concussion just like I did the other injuries I'd had from wrestling and playing football.\nMaybe take a day off, then try to tough it out as soon as I could.\nHad I known recovery might take a while and I was actually doing harm by pushing through, I could have made better decisions about my health.\nI do think that it is very helpful if caregivers understand that um it is a cognitive emotional stamina issue.\nSetting expectations for recovery is important not only for the patient, but for caregivers.\nIt's important to remember every concussion is different, and your loved one's emotional symptoms may persist.\nBut there are many ways you can support their recovery.\nUm, try and anticipate, you know, when you think they're going to need a little bit of a cognitive emotional break, uh, from whatever activity that they're involved in, uh, to be able to kind of recharge their cognitive emotional, you know, uh, stamina bank.\nUm, and then that kind of pacing is something that I think, um, parents and caregivers, adults, teachers can help, uh, in particular, the younger kids with.\nI think even the older kids, you know, middle school and high school aged can also have some trouble recognizing their own symptoms.\nI think what's difficult for them is that we then rely on them to be telling us, right?\nThey're supposed to be telling their teacher when they need a break.\nThey're supposed to have the insight and the ability to tell the parents when, you know, um they're they've overextended themselves.\nYou know, and yet, I I think it was a parent who, you know, asked me, you know, well, why are we expecting kids with a brain injury to do this?\nYou know?\nAnd so I think that that's 100% you know, on the money in terms of, you know, why we really need to make sure that the people that are around kids with concussion are really supporting them.\nAnd and there are definitely, um, absolutely ways where just having someone on the outside, external to yourself, be able to give you, you know, some feedback about, you know, now's probably a good time to take a break.\nI think can be helpful for kids going through a recovery with concussion as they're trying to extend their cognitive and emotional stamina, but maybe don't have 100% the ability to be able to tell when they're about to fall off a cliff with their stamina.\nUm, and that ends up, you know, that ends up giving you that pattern of recovery, which doesn't look like a nice straight line that has a nice even slope going up in the positive direction the entire time.\nYou're laying in bed and you feel completely fine, and then you get out of bed and you you go on the street and you hear someone honk their horn and it feels like there was like lightning right next to you.\nSo it's it's definitely a really, really hard process because it's not a straightforward path.\nIt's not like an ACL where you have almost a notebook given to you saying, this is what the rehab process is like.\nThere's going to be up and ups and downs, but for the most part you follow this and you're going to be fine.\nWith a concussion, it can go a thousand different paths and a thousand different ways.\nSo it's really, really hard.\nBut at the end of the day, some people have it a little bit easier than others, but you're going to get through it, and it's going to be frustrating, but you're going to be fine at the end of the day.\nWe tell our families a lot that, you know, it feels a lot more like a um, a jigsaw.\nYou know where basically you go up a little down a little, up a little down a little, up a little down a little but overall you're going up and you're improving.\nBut there's definitely you know that, you know, one step forward, two steps back, two steps forward, one step back.\nAnd that can be very frustrating when you're in the trenches with that.\nBut I think if you help set the stage that, you know, it's not just a straight line of recovery, um, it's more like a zigzag of recovery, um that, um that helps them ride out those, um, bumps a little bit.\nWhen we shift our gaze to treatment, Dr. Master says it's first important to take a step back, evaluate the patient, and name what they are experiencing.\nDepressive symptoms, anxious symptoms, are different from actual clinical depression or clinical anxiety from a diagnosis standpoint, right?\nAnd so I think from that standpoint, I think that obviously depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms are something that we absolutely see kids experiencing, people experiencing after concussion.\nIt really is a matter of A, identifying and naming it, right?\nLike just recognizing that it is what it is and that's what we're experiencing.\nAnd, and kind of getting, you know, that elephant in the room named, identified essentially.\nSo that you're not dancing around it and and they're not afraid to disclose it, you know, or embarrassed.\nAnd so, calling it out and naming it I think is um a big part of that.\nFirst step was obviously like showing my parents that I was upset because for the first couple of weeks, for whatever reason, I didn't I was bottling it up and didn't want to let it out and didn't want to show my parents.\nAnd then also just becoming more aware of of all my symptoms in general.\nFor example that symptom score sheet, remember the first couple weeks, like the scores were very low.\nAnd then as I became more in touch with my symptoms and my emotions, they they got higher, uh into like the eights and nines.\nSo yeah, just as as the weeks went on, I just became more uh, I would say, emotionally in touch, and more aware of my symptoms in in general.\nI wouldn't have gotten through it.\nI really don't think I would have if if I didn't enable myself to kind of break the barrier and and speak to my family and speak to my friends because most of the time people don't know what you're going through unless you speak to them about it.\nSo that's why, as crazy as it sounds, it was the best thing that ever happened to me because I like to think that I'm still working on it, but it really enabled me to to open up to people that I care about and just tell them, like, even like when I meet people now, I'm like, I tell them all the time, like, yeah, I'm a very anxious person in general.\nPeople are like, really?\nLike I never would have expected that.\nLike, you're so chill, you're so calm.\nBut yeah, speaking to people and especially when it comes to concussions, and telling them about the emotional and physical symptoms that you're having is is only going to help you in your recovery.\nAnd it's only going to help them understand what you're going through.\nDr. Master says that for many people, having social supports like friends and family is often enough to help them cope with the emotional symptoms of an acute concussion.\nI think that if you look at the resilience literature, which is also, you know, growing out there, um, from lots of different, you know, medical, um, fields and conditions, it will look at what are your resources that you have, and really draw on those first.\nAnd so we really do encourage kids and families to recognize that this is an issue, draw on those resources that they have, and then see, you know, in terms of the time course.\nYou know, if you're going on a time course in a trajectory where you're improving, you know, day to day and week to week, uh then maybe you don't need to have anything more from normal than that. If it starts to become clear that you're going to have a longer recovery, it's going to take a longer time, it's a little bit discouraging, there are struggles with school, not being in sports per se, then sometimes, um, it's, you know, useful then at that point to have a professional, um, you know, be involved whether it's a psychologist or some other counselor with training, with depression or anxiety. And I think a lot of times what we do try to have our kids and our families feel when they're participating in this whole process with us is that you know, having a concussion can make you feel helpless, that this entity is acting on you and you can't do anything about it. And what we like to try and do with our families is flip that script. \nThat basically, you know, there are small, little, but meaningful ways that you can have self- advocacy and control and and drive the bus so to speak. And so, you know, we talk about how, you know, right now you may be fine with the resources that you have that are supporting you. We need you to tell us when you feel like you need more help. And then we need you to also be, you know, listening and in a relationship with us where you'll hear us when we say that maybe we think that you might need professional help whether it's the mother or the father or it's, you know, uh us as part of the care team, or the patient themselves identifying that. And it, you know, obviously ends up being usually some kind of combination of all three. Trying to get back to some semblance of a routine that they recognize is really important for kids. We do know increasingly that um especially for our athletes, exercise plays a really important role, right? So, we all know that exercise plays an important role in general health and well-being and and mental health when you don't have a concussion, and it turns out at the right time, exercise is also um really helpful for concussion as well. And so, again, we're not necessarily saying that kids as soon as they have a concussion go out and work out hard, but we're also moving away from that whole concept of kids really having to be shut down for prolonged periods of time. So I think um some physical activity, we like to talk about general aerobic activity that is again, you know, uh light and manageable, not excessive, not really heavy-duty training, but just, you know, getting a little bit of a heart rate elevation, getting a little bit of a sweat going. That ends up being like a rising tide that raises all ships, right? So it makes everything in the brain better, it makes your body feel better, you know, everything. And so it's kind of like a general, you know, tonic for the soul. And um probably, you know, obviously has other biological bases for that. So I'm sure all my exercise physiology people are rolling their eyes, you know, at the way I'm describing it. But you know, exercise is in general a positive thing. And especially for our athletes, if they're used to exercising, removing exercise from them is like taking away a medication. You know, it's like they go through withdrawal. And so I think from that standpoint, we would say try to, you know, resume some normalcy in terms of a routine even though it's a changed routine from before. Draw on those supports, make sure you're continuing to be connected to your social supports, whether it's your friends or your family. and then, you know, exercise is definitely a piece of that. And even for kids who weren't athletes beforehand, find it's a great opportunity and a great help to them actually to get into some nice routine of physical exercise. Um, and then the exercise also tends to even out all of the sleep issues that I think sometimes, um, you know, arises after concussion.\nNoah leaned on his friends and family, but also found it helpful to speak with a therapist to cope with the anxiety and depression he felt after his concussion.\nI had a couple of anxiety attacks during those six months of my concussion rehab. And the only way that at least for me that I think I learned so much from those moments and yeah, I would say coping for me, may not be for everyone, but prior to my concussion, I had never spoke to a psychiatrist or or therapist. I felt weird about it, I didn't like opening up to some random person, but I would say my concussion was in October, um, and in January, I was having so many of these, um, anxiety attacks and so many dark days in terms of depression and anxiety. And I was like, I I need, I felt like I needed to speak to a professional. So I remember freaking out to my mom. I was like, mom, I gotta find someone. I gotta find someone. So from that, from then on out, like, there hasn't really been a month or honestly a couple of weeks gone by that I haven't spoken to a therapist or a psychiatrist. It's really the, for me it was like the best thing ever. Just I used to look forward to my sessions. Just half the time we didn't even speak about anything serious at all, but so for some people it may seem weird that I'm saying that, but for me, it was it was the best thing and that enabled me, like I said to to be more open speaking to a therapist, but most importantly, like being more open to speaking to everyone in my life. If you're at a bad point in your life, a lot of the time it feel it feels like it can't get any worse. So there's no, there's no harm in and going to speak to someone. Worst thing that happens is it's it's a waste it's a waste of an hour. Uh, but I would say most of the time you you learn some-\nthing and hopefully you can spark a great relationship with and a great almost mentorship with someone. Doesn't even have to be a therapist. It could be a coach, um, a mentor, anyone. Let your guard down a little bit and just and just speak to people because you'll learn so much about yourself and learn so much about other people as well and it's really the best thing that kind of the concussion rehab process taught me is just opening up and speaking to people.\nBack with Dr. Master now to discuss the relationship between suicide and concussion.\nI think it's important to actually talk about openly both amongst clinicians and providers when we take care of kids and when we're talking about it with kids and families. It's kind of like sex. If you think it's time to talk to your kids about sex, it's probably too late, right? And so, so basically, it's the same with suicide, that it's never too early to bring that up because I think if you talk about that, then in a way you're normalizing it, you're making it so that you're setting the example that it is okay to talk about this and it's okay for them to bring it up with you. Because that's what you want. You do want do not want them to not bring it up with you. I think that the other thing, so certainly, just as there is, you know, an apparent increase in depression and anxiety after concussion and mild traumatic brain injury, there appears to be a higher risk of suicide after a concussion and mild traumatic brain injury. And so I think from that standpoint, that's why this should be part of every conversation. And I think one of the things that we've really talked a lot about in terms of how we think about suicide in sort of kids versus adults and then also thinking about in terms of sort of how you stereotypically might view it versus maybe what actually happens. One of the big issues in particular in adolescent suicide is the impulsivity aspect, the lack of frontal control. You know, already they're a little bit behind the eight ball because they have not fully myelinated their frontal lobe. And so, they haven't fully developed all of those executive function and inhibiting behaviors that um are self-control behaviors. And so, not having that fully developed and then getting a concussion which may make that even more vulnerable can make you vulnerable to suicide. And so, that's why also when I see my patients, not only do I ask them, you know, do they feel sad down or worried or do they feel bad enough that they want to hurt themselves or anybody else. I do ask if they have access to anything dangerous like guns, other weapons, you know, hunting knives, dangerous prescription drugs. And I just say, you know, I ask that of everybody, right? And and most people um are not, you know, shocked or negatively inclined to answer. They they they often appreciate it. And the kids often appreciate it because I think it just shows that we want to care for them. Uh because if you look at just the suicide literature, what happens is that um often times, you know, in when they've done studies interviewing teenagers who attempted suicide but failed, thank goodness, there really was only a matter of maybe 30 minutes between the moment when they got the idea and then they acted on it. So there's a lot of impulsivity there. So, if you're impulsive, um, you want to have it be a situation where they can be impulsive and yet safe and not have anything happen that is irretrievable. And that's where not having a gun in the home or having a gun that is locked and separate from the ammunition is really, really critical in terms of a safety issue. So, I think from that standpoint, suicide is not common after concussion. So I certainly don't want anyone to take that away from this, but it is something that there is a higher risk, higher than the general population and we definitely have to acknowledge that. And so I think, um the way that we do that is to normalize the conversation, make that conversation an open one that can be open and nonjudgmental and supportive and loving and caring.\nI asked Dr. Master what caregivers need to look out for in their loved ones who may be struggling after concussion.\nWell, when it comes to warning signs, I think it's really challenging because there may not be any warning signs, and that's the challenge. And what I encourage parents, especially of adolescents, is really to encourage open lines of communication. I think these are uh the times where you want to really fall back on really open lines of communication that are supportive, non-judgmental, caring. And and really, you know, not trying to really place a lot of pressure, you know, either for the child to get better, you know, or, you know, uh again get themselves out of this, that this is a process that everyone has to go through. I think that obviously um if you have that kind of open communication, hopefully the child, the teenager will be able to tell you when they're feeling more despairing or despondent. I think that there are also other behavioral manifestations besides just verbal, um, communication. Um, that there is, you know, significant, you know, withdrawal from activities and friends and lack of interest in, you know, things that they used to be interested in in hobbies and school and sports. And so I think all of those things would be things that we'd have them, you know, watch out for. And again, I think from that standpoint, teenagers, they can hide a lot, but they also do wear a lot on their sleeves as well. So I do think it is just a matter of parents being aware that this is a possibility and just by\nbeing aware, I think that that is more than half the battle in terms of laying the groundwork for having those conversations, you know, paying attention. And sometimes, I think it's really important for kids to realize, you know, they may not realize themselves that they're depressed, but they need someone outside themselves to be able to say to them, you know, you're really just not yourself right now. Can we talk about that? And so I think that those are all things that you want to be able to have those kinds of conversations about and to be looking out for so that you can act on them if needed.\nIf you or someone you know needs help coping with depression or suicidal thoughts, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is free and available 24/7 at 1-800-273-8255. It's easy to feel misunderstood, isolated, and alone during concussion recovery, because nobody can see your injury. Not only that, but your symptoms might stop you from participating in your favorite activities. Both Noah and Dr. Master told us one of the best things you can do to cope is to open up about what you're going through.\nI definitely had a lot of like fear of kind of missing out on some of the great moments. One vivid example I have was the fact that after a couple of big wins that we had to get into the conference tournament and we beat a couple of ranked opponents in our regular season, I couldn't even celebrate with the team in the locker room because the the music was so loud. Um, like, I had to sit outside with one of my assistant coaches like 15, 20 feet away from the locker room and my symptoms were still pretty bad at that point. Like the music was still bothering me. And I remember feeling so frustrated and so sad. Like, wow, like it's it's bad enough that I can't play with my team, can't sit on the bench, but like, I can't even like be in the locker room after with my team. But like, we've kind of spoke about if you if you speak to your friends about it, like a simple thing is like they they may be more likely to just kind of like stay at home with you more often and just like sit on the couch or go for a walk with you because early on, I remember my my friends playing video games. I couldn't even sit with them on the couch. Um, so it's it's it's definitely really, really hard if you're an athlete or even just a normal kid in in college or high school and it's hard to kind of escape it. But yeah, just people may think that, oh, Noah's changed, like he's not hanging out with us as much often. But if you explain to them the reason why you don't want to go to a party or don't even want to go to someone's house to sit on the couch because your headache is still bad, they'll understand.\nI think that it is very difficult because it's an invisible injury. They look fine on the outside, they're not wearing a cast of any kind that can signal, you know, the community, um as to what they're going through. I think that, you know, depending on which developmental stage you're at, it's very hard to be able to verbalize to others what you're going through. And so, again, I think that certainly in this day and age, most kids will have had some friends who've had a concussion and so drawing on that is helpful. And I think certainly, uh being able to share with really close friends, even if they haven't had concussions, uh what you're going through is really important. Uh whether it's friends, siblings, parents. But I would, I would really encourage the kids to, you know, work through that and and not have an anger reaction to it. I think that the anger reaction can be very self-destructive. And and so we really try to validate what they're experiencing, that what they're experiencing, you know, is, you know, very real, not made up, and they likely are being misunderstood by many out there. And then we try and encourage them and talk about how, you know, for instance, you know, most of our patients and families have been a lot of education and training for their schools, right? So when they've gone through a concussion, they've taught their teachers, their guidance counselors, their principles and their athletic trainers and coaches, you know, what it's like to go through a concussion. And so that's a real contribution and a real gift that they're giving to their school community that way and that we understand them that this is something that again, I tease my patients sometimes in that they are special, but they're not that special because this is actually a very common experience that they're having.\nThat's right. You're not that special and you're certainly not alone. There are so many of us who have experienced concussion and recovered and feel better than ever. Like Noah, who is now playing professional soccer in the USL. We'll leave you with a final encouraging message from Noah.\nI promise you you'll get to the point where you'll you'll be completely fine. Because I don't think there's, I'm sure there are, but there's not a lot of concussions that are as traumatic as mine and a lot of positions that involve you doing the same thing over and over again, coming out for balls at people's knees and and heads and feet and things like that. So I feel like if I can do it, then most people can as well. And so you just have to embrace all the little tiny wins and success moments you have and then before you know it, you're gonna you're gonna stop thinking about the word concussion and you're going to stop thinking that you're going to get hurt again. You're gonna you're going to stop worrying about it. It's going to take a lot of time and before you know it, you're going to be like, wow, like I felt like I've never had a concussion anymore. And the cool part about it is you you're going to learn a lot about yourself just like with any injury and you get to bring that with you, but then you'll you'll you'll stop worrying about all the all the bad things and you'll be you'll be able to to go on with your life and and stop worrying about it before you know it.\njoining us.

Until then, I'm Dr. Chris Nowinski. Keep fighting.\n\nEP5: Cognitive Symptoms w/ Dr. Dan Daneshvar and Isaiah Osborne\n\nComing up on this episode of Concussion Game Plan.\nhelps to hear from somebody that has gone through it themselves and just kind of have that guidance. You know, know that you're not alone, you're not the only person going through it.\nHey everyone. It's Dr. Chris Nowinski, co-founder and CEO of the Concussion Legacy Foundation.\nWelcome to episode five of CLF's Concussion Game Plan podcast.\nThis episode, we're digging into the cognitive symptoms of concussion, such as issues with memory, focus, concentration and speech.\nWe've brought in Dr. Dan Danvar to explain why those symptoms happen and how they are treated.\nFormer high school and college football player Isaiah Osborne will also join us for today's episode.\nIsaiah speaks candidly about the darkest days of his concussion recovery and how he made it through.\nHere on Concussion Game Plan, we want to give you the information you need to set yourself up for a complete recovery, but also to prepare you and your loved ones for the challenges you may face.\nLet's get to it.\nSo, cognitive symptoms really comprise everything that your brain is responsible for in terms of how you think, what you remember, whether you're able to pay attention and concentrate.\nAnd uh after a concussion, cognitive symptoms are unfortunately some of the most common symptoms that can occur.\nDr. Dan Danvar is a doctor at Spalding Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston and a faculty member at Harvard Medical School.\nHis own experiences playing sports inspired him to specialize in neuroscience.\nAs a neuroscientist at MIT, I was fascinated by how the brain is this remarkable reverse engineering problem.\nAnd as a wrestler in high school and in college and as a football player in high school, I had my fair share hits to the head.\nSo, studying the long-term effects of repetitive head impacts and traumatic brain injury has allowed me to combine these interests in a way that uh helps me provide answers for my patients in the clinic.\nDr. Danvar sees patients immediately after they have suffered a traumatic brain injury and follows them through their recovery process.\nHe walks us through the common cognitive symptoms after concussion and explains why they happen, starting with memory issues.\nProblems with memory are related to the area of the brain in the frontal lobe.\nAnd those uh problems can occur because a concussion is an electrochemical problem with signaling between different parts of the brain.\nAnd so the disruption in the cells as they try to communicate with one another actually ends up making it more difficult for you to do tasks that you normally would be able to do.\nYou know, I'd be having a conversation with people just like we're having now and I'd be forgetting, you know, what am I what am I talking about as I'm talking about it.\nAnd that that's really scary. It's really scary.\nYou know, I'd be at work, boss would be talking to me, asking me a question. I'd start to answer it. All of a sudden, I forget what the question was and where I was going with my answer.\nYou know, at that point, I'm kind of just rambling on and on trying to get back on track and you never quite get there. That that memory or that um that thought is gone and it's like literally just went into a black hole and you can't find it.\nAnd now they're looking at you like, what are you talking about? Like that had nothing to do with what I asked you and you know, what do you say? Like I I forgot what you said 10 seconds ago. I'm sorry. Like that that doesn't sound right.\nIsaiah Osborne was a force on the football field, dominating his high school competition in San Diego as a running back.\nHe went on to play one year for the University of Sioux Falls in South Dakota before concussions forced him to step away from the game.\nHe estimates he suffered several concussions, but his worst came after a hit during a game his junior year of high school.\nI'm actually, scored a touchdown on this play so, you know, everyone's all happy, excited, we scored.\nUh, but the guy after I crossed the goal line, I kind of let up. He still tackled me and I pretty much fell all the way down and just my head straight went straight into the ground.\nImmediately, I remember my head was just an excruciating pain. But, you know, I popped right up. I looked fine. I thought I was fine. And um, I think that's what throws a lot of people off too is that, you know, they think you have to be knocked out or you know, need help to get up. And that's not always the case.\nBut anyway, I headed to the sideline. Next drive went back out there. I played running back, so I was running the ball. I got the ball on a handoff and a guy hit me, like barely. This is a routine hit and I lost my balance and I dropped the ball like hysterically.\nAt this point, I was kind of like, I remember, I was shaking and just feeling really weak.\nYou know, I go to the sideline, you know, coach is mad of course because I just fumbled the ball and I remember him yelling at me, but not really understanding what he was saying.\nYou know, you fast forward to that weekend because it was a Friday night that we played. I don't really remember anything happening that weekend. I probably slept the whole time, that's what I did a lot of times during football season. But come Monday, I woke up and, you know, the sun was coming through the blinds like, you know, like normal and you wake up in the morning, and it felt like the sun was in the room.\nIt was so ridiculously bright. Like, I'd never experienced this part in my life. This was new.\nAnd I get up and then I notice every little sound like, you know, me just walking, me moving the blanket. It was just, it sounded like a jet was in the room. It was super duper loud.\nI didn't connect it to a concussion or anything like that at all. It was just like, what the heck, I'm having a bad day. I get to school, I'm walking around all day with my head down, my eyes are bloodshot red.\nI'm having a hard time following any conversation. I'm not participating in class. and this continued for a few days. It's like Tuesday or Wednesday when a teacher actually called me outside and asked me about the game that we just played on Friday. She was like, you know, did you experience any big hits? Like, what I don't know why she's asking me all these questions.\nI'm like, you know, yeah, there was that one big hit on Friday that I took, but, you know, that was Friday. That was last week, you know, this is now.\nShe told me, I think you have a concussion.\nAnd that's the first, my mind was blown. That's the first time I ever heard that. This was my 13th season playing football. And that's the first time I ever heard that.\nI didn't really know what that meant. I was like, okay, like, I'm still breathing. I'm still alive. Like, what's next?\nWhat Isaiah is about to describe here unfortunately happens far too often. Concussions are looked past and played through.\nI've been there as an athlete where you know you don't feel right, but the only thing on your mind is pushing through the pain and helping your team.\nWe're taught to be tough, but over the last decade, we've learned how continuing to play through a concussion increases the risk for prolonged recovery and more serious problems such as second impact syndrome.\nAgain, I thought I'd be fine within a couple of days. I wasn't really worried about it and I really wasn't. Actually the symptoms just, they kept on rolling, they kept on rolling, they kept on going. And, you know, eventually, the light sensitivity and the sound sensitivity went away.\nBut school got increasingly harder. I felt really dull. I don't know how to describe it, but it was like a really dull feeling and um, I kept playing.\nAnd that's probably the worst part of it all. I never, I never stopped. I kept going because I had that, you know, first of all, I was told I was okay. And I had that football player mentality of, you know, if I can walk and talk, then I'm okay to play football.\nIsaiah didn't recognize he suffered a concussion and never received treatment from doctors.\nHe went on to suffer many of the common cognitive symptoms we'll cover today, including problems with his memory.\nFor most people following a concussion, the memory symptoms last about seven days.\nUm, however, a significant minority and it's around one in 10 or so uh can have problems that last even longer than that.\nThe important thing to know is that every single brain injury is different. And so the memory problems might not actually be just from the the memory impairment itself directly related to the concussion.\nYou can have other concussion symptoms that can also cause you to have trouble with your memory and that might last longer than than the seven days.\nSo you could have imagine problems with a pain in parts of your body that distract you and cause uh difficulty for you to remember things.\nYou can have uh problems with depression that have been shown to uh have result in issues with people remembering things.\nAnd these different symptoms can either mimic memory problems or actually exacerbate those memory problems as well.\nfelt at that time like I'm a totally different person. And that that, you know, that kind of ties in everything from the not being able to think straight, having a hard time processing, losing the memory, behavior. All that kind of starts to change. And I mean it totally makes sense because your brain, it controls everything you do. You know what I mean?\nSo you you injure it or damage it, it's going to change and it's going to change everything you do. It's going to change your thoughts, your ability to learn, your speech even, I had a hard time talking for a while. It, you know, it totally makes sense why it happens. But to experience it, it's it's really rough. Just looking in the mirror and not really recognizing who you once were.\nAfter one of my concussions in 2003, for the first time in my life, I forgot my line on live television.\nI mean we may not share the same ethnic background.\nWe may not share the same ethnic background, but we may not share the same ethnic background, but you can trust me.\nWhat you hear there is me trying to jump start my brain and try to remember what my next line is by continuing to repeat the line that came before it.\nEventually, it clicked, but it really crushed my confidence and I could not understand why this suddenly happened to me.\nWhen your brain is not functioning the way you're used to, like Isaiah said, it can be really difficult and demoralizing, but there are ways to feel better.\nFor memory issues, Dr. Danvar recommends a multi-step approach.\nWhen it comes to memory specifically, there's uh a really multimodal treatment plan that I I'd initiate.\nUm, the the first pillar of that treatment plan would involve things like cognitive rehabilitation, which are exercises for memory that are often under the guidance of either a speech therapist or a physician or sometimes occupational therapist as well.\nThese can involve utilizing specific exercises or compensatory strategies, uh like writing in notebooks or using timers or alarms or messages, keeping task lists.\nThere are also medications that are options, although though we we we tend to I personally tend to uh prefer the uh nonpharmacologic uh treatment modalities first because every medication has side effects associated with it.\nAnd that's something you'd be able to definitely talk about with your physician.\nAnd then uh to round out the the treatment, multimodal treatment plan, I'd want to address other factors that have been shown to uh worsen memory.\nUh things like difficulty with sleep, um other medications that you might be taking, pain medications or anti-colergic medications like Benadryl or something along those lines, uh improving exercise, limiting uh things like drugs or alcohol. Um all of those uh will help you on your path towards recovery.\nAnother cognitive symptom of concussion is having difficulties with attention and concentration. Dr. Danvar explains why those challenges may happen.\nAs you look around wherever you are right now, take a look at all of the different things that you can see.\nNow, it's your brain's job to focus on the specific item in front of you that you're interested in and disregard the many other things that are in your visual field that you interact with every day that are distractions.\nAnd so when your brain's injured, you have a harder time tuning out those distractions and focusing on the things that you normally would be able to focus on.\nI I couldn't read first of all. I totally forgot about that. Like, I no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't read, had a hard time following conversations.\nIt's important to understand if you are someone with a pre-existing condition like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or if concentrating is difficult for you before a brain injury, the concussion may make things a lot worse.\nSo in those individuals, it's even more important to get help early, to make sure that you're addressing the issue and that you're being proactive.\nIf you have a concussion, things like stimulating environments where you might have a lot of distractions, the different psychosocial stressors that you might have in your life that could also increase the cognitive burden that you're under and that would exacerbate any of the symptoms you're having as well.\nWhatever you can do to identify and minimize the triggers in your environment and any possible exacerbating factors will really help you on your concussion recovery.\nFor individuals who are struggling with the problems with attention, I'd recommend the same strategies if they had prior problems with uh attention or if they didn't.\nUh really you want to set yourself up in a position to succeed when it comes with attention. Uh that means uh things like giving yourself more time while you're recovering to do tasks, uh to schedule tasks that require a lot of attention and focus to the times of the day when you're at your best, when you're well rested, when you're refreshed, to try to limit sources of distraction when you're engaging in a task that requires a lot of attention and to focus on one task at a time instead of trying to multitask, even if it's something that you otherwise would be able to to do and to accomplish.\nRemember that you're in this recovery phase and your brain needs a little more time.\nThat slowing down and taking one task at a time that Dr. Danvar is talking about is easier said than done.\nIt can be tempting to want to push through and challenge your brain to do all the tasks you're used to doing, but it's so important to slow down.\nTaking a few days or weeks to pull back on activities and take breaks will be worth it in the long run.\nRemember, this is not forever, and your brain just needs time to heal.\nFeeling like you're in a fog or feeling slowed down are just different manifestations of the same kinds of problems that you're having with uh that you might have with attention or with memory.\nUh, and it's because your brain isn't functioning in the way that it normally would.\nNow, speech is actually a particularly interesting part of the the brain and how it's processing, especially in relation with the concussion because uh speech involves a complex coordination between multiple different parts of the brain from the frontal lobe to the temporal lobe, to the parietal lobe and the connections between there, from the front basically to the to towards the back of your brain.\nAnd when those connections are disrupted by the concussion, they're not able to communicate as well with one another.\nAnd so, if you think of it as like a road that's been damaged, those are the those roads are the pathways between your cells.\nWhen those get damaged by the concussion, it takes time for them to heal and to recover back to normal.\nYou might have an issue thinking of the word you're trying to think of and recalling it and then being able to speak it.\nAll of those different parts of speaking are are controlled by different aspects of the brain, pulling up the word and being able to actually speak the word.\nAnd so if that pathway isn't disrupted, then your actual speech becomes impaired.\nIsaiah remembers how frightening it was struggling with his speech.\nGrowing up I I always gave speeches like here and there, not like every single day, but um I mean even elementary school, I was what was I? I was like treasure of the school, so I got to go up and talk, um few times throughout the year.\nHigh school, you know, when you get rewards or whatever, you get to go up and talk and so like I've always enjoyed kind of speaking in front of people and I always had the voice for it, my voice was deep, I spoke very clearly.\nAnd it's like, all of a sudden, I had a hard time finding words. It felt like at times I was talking with a sock in my mouth. That's how I describe it.\nLike your your mouth just becomes mushy and again it doesn't make sense, nothing's really makes sense but you're going through it.\nSo, you know, to hit that point too, that was, that was pretty scary. And that's basically what it is. It feels like you're talking with a sock in your mouth, certain words don't come out correctly, but you're saying one thing and something else comes out, kind of at, you know, that working memory kind of ties into it too.\nYou know, when you start to forget what you're even saying, now you're rambling. Nothing really makes sense. You know, there's a point in time where I didn't even really I didn't want to open my mouth sometimes because I was like, I don't I don't know how this is going to come out. It's probably not going to come out right.\nAnd you know, when that happens, people, again, they look at you like, what is wrong with you? And I'm thinking, man, I don't I don't know what's wrong with me either, man. Like it's just not it's just not coming out.\nIf you have problems with your speech or with language, it's important to uh improve your self-monitoring and self-regulation.\nAnd that's part of what's taught in cognitive rehabilitation by speech therapists and by language therapists because by better identifying the uh types of settings that cause issues for you and by better identifying the pathways that cause problems before you go onto them, you can better approach these problems in the real world.\nOne thing I'll say to people is like, nobody knows you the way you know you. You know, you're in your own body.\nYou know when something's different, you know, whether it be speech, uh whether it be the thoughts, whether it be, you know, you, you recognize when something's different before anybody else does.\nThe most important thing to do with concussion recovery is to listen to yourself and that's the best indicator of whether you're stressing your cognition too much.\nSo if your symptoms start to get worse, if your headaches start to get worse, if you're struggling more with your memory, your concentration or finding tasks increasingly frustrating, those are all indications that you might be pushing it a little too hard and an indication that you should start utilizing some of the compensatory strategies that I referred to in the multimodal treatment approach to concussion.\nAnd the important thing is, you don't need to remember to do it on your own.\nIt's important to make sure you have a coach in on your side in the form of a clinician that's guiding you through the recovery process.\nFinding that person to guide you through your recovery process can be hard.\nYou might not want to let your family or friends in on what you're going through, but Dr. Danvar and Isaiah say reaching out and asking for support is key.\nOne of the most frustrating aspects of these concus- concussions and concussive symptoms are that they're in they're so invisible and very isolating.\nThe most important thing to do then is to seek help.\nThe Concussion Legacy Foundation has a number of great resources for teaming up individuals with others that that have gone through these these problems and that uh that can help.\nAnd then also to make sure that you utilize the resources that are available to you.\nSo in schools, there's uh alternate education plans that can help basically make sure that you're not overburdening your your brain while it's recovering.\nAnd and then of course, physicians and uh therapists and other folks are all in your corner.\nWell the very first thing that helped me, well, you know, first was reaching out to other people, finding out that there were other people going through this.\nAnd I mean really that's just you start to feel supported. Because, you know, I look around in my immediate, you know, circle, nobody else was going through this in my immediate circle. So, you know, I I felt very alone.\nYou know, I I isolated a lot of times and you know, finally something told me to go on Facebook and see if there's a group or something out there. There's got to be somebody out there on the internet talking about this. And I found some groups and um, you know, that that was step one, just finding other people going through the same thing, people that understand what you're going through, even, you know, some of it's hard to put into words, but they know exactly what you're talking about.\nAnd that definitely was an eye opener and that was the start of me getting better.\nThat connection with others who understand can be so comforting.\nWe want to take a moment to speak directly to any caregivers who may be listening.\nWe understand how hard it can be to see your loved ones slow down, struggling to communicate or having difficulty processing information as well as they used to be able to.\nIf your loved one is experiencing any of the cognitive symptoms we've covered, Dr. Danvar has some valuable advice.\nThe important thing to remember as a caregiver is again, that these symptoms are invisible and isolating.\nAnd as a result, the person who's injured can feel very alone.\nSo as the caregiver, it's incredibly important then to make sure that you are reaching out and supporting that loved one.\nOn top of that, it can often be difficult for even a person without a brain injury to navigate the healthcare environment to make sure that they're getting all the support that they need.\nAnd that's also where a caregiver can come in because the caregiver can basically help identify the different clinicians and and therapists and other folks that are all as part of a package able to help the concussed individual.\nCLF is here to help caregivers who may need assistance navigating the healthcare system for their loved one after a concussion.\nIf you're looking for doctor recommendations, treatment suggestions, or peer support, reach out to our team at the CLF Helpline.\nWe provide personalized one-on-one support and would be glad to help you and your loved one through the recovery process.\nSubmit a request at concussionfoundation.org/helpline today and a member of our staff will be in touch.\nNow, back to the episode.\nIf you're experiencing cognitive symptoms after concussion, it's easy to feel insecure if you can't perform at school or work like you used to.\nWe want you to know that it's normal to be feeling that way.\nI was definitely getting headaches like pretty much every single day. And then yeah, it was just like, I'm not smart anymore. It's like you know, I I've always considered myself someone who could, you know, I was pretty intelligent. I was um, a self-learner in a lot of things in and outside of school. And then all of a sudden, it was like that that went out the door. You could show me a million times. It just wouldn't click in my head, you know, what you're trying to teach me. And, you know, at that point I I did kind of like start to lose interest in school, I guess you can say and I became more concerned with just making sure my grade was up, whatever it took, but not really learning the information because that was just way too much. That just became impossible at a point. You know, so it's it's hard to explain. Like you hear it, but it doesn't it doesn't settle in your head, that information that you're being taught. It's like going in one ear and out the other basically.\nAfter you have a concussion, it can be incredibly jarring to your confidence, to who you feel like you are as a person when you're not thinking the way you normally do, when you're not able to do the kinds of things you normally do.\nIt can be be scary. But the important thing to remember again is that people get better after their injuries.\nThat if you get the proper treatment and the proper training with your doctors and your therapists, you'll get better as well. And you'll come back go back to your normal thinking and memory and behavior.\nAlong with finding support, Isaiah found healing by changing his habits.\nI'm definitely, you know, changed the things I do as far as, you know, eating even, you know, what I drink, everything I do now is is for my head.\nSo, I'm thinking about that, you know, I I cut out alcohol pretty much 100% because I I don't want to potentially mess myself up that way. I you know, I'm sticking with the CBD. I'm pretty much just lifestyle, you know, everything, you know, making sure I go to bed on time, I'm not staying up all night. You know, making sure I wake up in the morning, not kind of laying in, getting, you know, one thing they focus on is getting blue light. So I make sure, you know, I step outside for a few minutes and just wake myself up.\nYou know, it's like, it's really, it's a lot of the stuff that I wasn't capable of doing for a long time.\nThe most important thing to remember is that while, although while you're recovering, things can seem bleak and things can seem very isolating.\nPeople get better after concussions. So you really have to trust the recovery process, make sure you have clinical guidance and that you're getting the care you need, but you you will get better as long as you're properly treated.\nYou might be feeling this way now, but it it could get better and it will get better.\nI was in a place where I didn't think it was going to get better. I thought I was stuck.\nYou know, I'm doing all these searches like, what what can help? Everything I'm finding is like, oh yeah, there's pretty much nothing you could do. At this point, you're pretty much stuck like that. So I I thought this was my new life forever, you know. I didn't think there was anything out there that would help.\nI thought this was just it. So definitely know that that's not the case because I, I was rock bottom. I was in a horrible place. I never saw myself coming back, you know, and here I am.\nSo, I'm very thankful to be here today and be able to tell my story.\nAmazing.\nI can't tell you how happy it makes me feel to hear inspirational messages like Isaiah's.\nThank you so much to Isaiah and Dr. Danvar for joining us for today's episode of Concussion Game Plan.\nIf you have any questions about what you heard today, or looking for more information on concussion or post-concussion syndrome or want to get involved with our work, please visit our website at concussionfoundation.org.\nIf you enjoyed this episode, please leave us a five-star rating and review. Your review helps more people find us in their recovery journeys.\nFeeling better is one thing, but feeling totally ready to return to school or work after concussion is another.\nComing up in episode six, we'll explore strategies, tips and guidance to navigate the return to school and return to work process.\nUntil then, I'm Dr. Chris Nowinski. Keep fighting.\n\nEP6: Return to Learn w/ Dr. Brenda Eagan-Johnson and Giuliana Calia\n\nand I didn't have any moment of cognitive rest, which is something that I would go back and redo in a moment.\nHey everyone, I'm Dr. Chris Nowinski, co-founder and CEO of the Concussion Legacy Foundation.\nWelcome to episode six of the Concussion Game Plan Podcast.\nAs we wind down season one of the podcast, we're ready to tackle one of the most difficult aspects of the concussion recovery journey, returning to school or work.\nYou're going to love our guest for this episode.\nDr. Brenda Egan Johnson specializes in helping children, teens, and young adults return to school after concussion.\nShe shares some awesome advice on how parents can best support their student with a concussion.\nWe'll also hear from Juliana Calia.\nJuliana is a Boston University graduate who has suffered multiple concussions.\nIn this episode, Juliana shares how she navigated returning to the classroom and office after a concussion.\nShe shares her tips for managing the recovery process, best practices for how to communicate concussion limitations with teachers and employers, and what she wishes she had done differently in her recovery.\nLet's head to the slopes to hear about her concussion experience.\nI was on the ski mountain on a very icy slope, and unfortunately, I hit an I hit an object that I didn't see and was ejected from my skis head first into the ice.\nUm, immediately after, I was far more concerned about my wrists than my head even though my head had hit the ice first.\nAnd it wasn't till about an hour later, where I started to feel really nauseous when I was skiing, really clouded.\nUm, again, there was no obvious pain, and I felt that I was safe because I had a helmet on.\nSo, it wasn't until actually the next day, I went to class, I was in a lab and I actually left and I vomited and in that moment I immediately sought out.\nI sought out student health services and um was diagnosed with a concussion.\nIn the first week, the the nausea kind of gave way to the headaches.\nI felt really jarring migraines unlike a normal headache that I might feel when I was sick, especially when I was outside and out and about walking to a classroom or walking to the store.\nAnd I was also extremely um just feeling very clouded over and the the final symptom I think really affected me, I couldn't see well at all.\nSo I was everything was double for that first week.\nI think the first week I was under the impression that it would go away on its own because I'd had experiences with concussions before where that was the path of recovery luckily.\nAnd so I went through a week of class without really having any um learning happening.\nGenerally medical providers, the healthcare providers say a student should be off school for no more than one to two days and that's often the recommendation and then the students return to school.\nDr. Brenda Egan Johnson is the Brain Steps project director for a brain injury school re-entry consulting program.\nShe's based in Pennsylvania and has 15 years of experience in the field.\nShe helps children and their families in schools after brain injury.\nWe know it's so important to have students go back to school within one to two days as long as the school is ready to support the student with academic supports because the longer a student is out of school, you know, the literature is telling us now that they're experiencing if they're pulled from their friends, from their screen time for long periods of time, they're experiencing social isolation, anxiety, depression, panic disorder, even suicidal ideation.\nSo keeping an eye out for that, we we ask all school psychologists, all school nurses, at four weeks if a student has not recovered from their concussion, do a quick screening for depression and anxiety.\nSome students may simply be too symptomatic to return to school two days after the injury and may require additional time.\nRegardless of their timeline to return, Dr. Egan Johnson advises parents to involve their school as soon as possible.\nParents and schools need to communicate from the get-go.\nAs soon as a child has a concussion, the most important thing that a parent can do is notify the school.\nThe literature tells us that there is a lack of processes and communication in place between health care providers, school staff and families after all severities of traumatic brain injury.\nIf a parent doesn't notify the school that a concussion happened, and if the student isn't a student athlete or the athletic trainer knew about the concussion, the school may have no idea that a student had a concussion.\nSo identification is the first thing that needs to happen.\nNext, the parent should sign release forms with the school nurse.\nSo the school nurse can speak with the health care providers if the student is seeing a health care provider.\nAlong with the school nurse, teachers have an important role to play.\nIt's important they understand students with a concussion likely need accommodations while they recover.\nAccommodations should be aligned to a student's specific symptoms.\nCommon accommodations schools can provide include but are not limited to, assigning a peer to take notes for the student, reducing assignments to only essential work, allowing additional time for assignments, allowing students to take frequent breaks or scheduled naps in a nurse's office, dimming the lights, and allowing students to wear sunglasses or headphones.\nIf your child's had a concussion, if your school does not have any kind of concussion management team in place, a parent can um do a quick Google search.\nThere are a lot of academic supports listed.\nThe CDC has a lot of good ones.\nOne is called Tips for Teachers after Concussion and it lists basic academic supports that a school, a teacher can implement.\nAnd the purpose of that is, you want when a student comes back to school, you don't want to frontload them with all of the academic thinking demands because that will spike symptoms.\nInstead, the school should put some supports in place such as um, build in a few breaks into the student's day.\nIf you can borrow a student's notes, borrow someone else in your class, get their notes, make copies of them.\nAnything you can do so that you don't have to overload yourself.\nWhen your brain when you start to feel symptoms, it's your brain's way of saying you're doing too much right now.\nI'm trying to recover, back off.\nSo that's what I tell students when you start to have symptoms, slow down.\nWhat can you do to make things easier on yourself?\nSo things like that cut back on the amount of cognitive load or exertion that the student has and hopefully that can keep them under their symptom threshold.\nSo we can keep them in school, in the learning environment rather than spiking a migraine by noon because they've been thinking so hard and then they have to go home every day.\nJuliana understands balancing that threshold all too well.\nHer symptoms drastically affected her ability to participate in class.\nI would feel the best in the mornings.\nI'd wake up with a dull headache that was kind of in the back of my skull, something that you'd have if you were dehydrated.\nAnd then the minute I made the quarter mile walk from my dorm to class that dull headache would be throbbing already.\nKind of that feeling where you could feel like your heart beating in your head.\nAnd when I was in the classroom, there were moments where I would, you know, I'd actually zone in for about 10 minutes and I my best example is organic chemistry.\nI'd be there and then I would like 10 minutes just feel a sharp pain.\nIt wouldn't be it wouldn't be lasting, but just a sharp pain that would just take me out and I couldn't zoom back in.\nLike because I I just had felt that like stabbing pain and immediately started to think about everything but the problem on the board.\nYou might not have had any symptoms at home while you were resting, but suddenly your symptoms are spiking.\nAnd it's making you hard, you know, making it hard to learn, making it hard to read, to concentrate.\nIf so, you should take a break.\nThat's why we always encourage schools, let the student build in, you the staff, build in the break for the student so that that student doesn't have to be the one to determine when they take a break because if you leave it up to the student, they're typically going to take a break when they're already symptomatic.\nAnd we want to prevent that if possible.\nYou know, I was going to classes because I felt obligated to, but my I wasn't present for most of it.\nThere were moments where I was just gripping my chair um in pain or to prevent nausea, to kind of ground me.\nI felt like I couldn't remember things like I used to.\nSo for exams I would study for a week and then test myself and feel like I hadn't studied at all.\nThe consistent pain became too overwhelming for Juliana.\nWhen it set in that she was not getting better, she looked for professional help.\nI sought out physical therapy because it was the quickest treatment I could start.\nUh seeing a neurologist can sometimes take a while to see a specialist and that was really helpful in my vision and which decreased my headaches when I helped my vision.\nAnd we just did a lot of spatial therapy, so recognizing how close things are, how far things are and focusing on objects.\nAnd I was really have to say I was diligent about my home exercises because I knew that doing those could help me.\nUm, one of them was sticking a sticky note on the wall and then looking at the sticky note and then looking at another object and then looking back at that sticky note and then looking somewhere else in the room and just that again, recognizing, you know, focal points in space back and forth.\nOther ones involved focusing while walking around.\nSo I would be cooking dinner and while walking to the pantry, I would try to just focus on my thumb in front of me.\nGoing to PT and sticking to her exercises were instrumental to Juliana's recovery, but she also learned to make adjustments to her daily life to feel her best.\nI'd like every time I left my house every morning, I would make sure I'd have these four things.\nThe first, I'd always wear noise cancelling headphones even if I wasn't playing music because music sometimes was too much for me and they were the little earbud ones, not the over the head ones and I wore those 24/7.\nIf you saw me without those I was going home to go get them.\nAnd it was really helpful to just muffle out all of the sound stimulation that was happening.\nBoston University's on Commonwealth Avenue.\nThere's the T roaring by, there's thousands of students having conversations all the time.\nAnd I would even wear them in the classroom but like they weren't the ones where you couldn't hear anything.\nSo it would just lower the the volume of the professor or a video that was playing to a more reasonable sound.\nSo that was really helpful.\nThe second was I purchased blue light glasses and that was really helpful for lectures because you know, I can turn the blue light off on my computer, but that's not helpful when the screen above me is like blaring blue light.\nSo that was something I wore every day and if I, before I got those I actually wore sunglasses.\nI know that's a kind of a common thing and you look funny, but it was definitely helpful.\nThe third thing I have, I used was a fidget cube which eventually turned into a fidget ring and those when I when I was just overwhelmed with like symptoms whether it's nausea or a migraine or just I couldn't see, I would just focus on just that.\nEven if I was in the classroom um or if I was walking down the street, being able to like narrow like my focus to just one object.\nAnd then the last thing is a phone, but I mean everyone has their phone but how I used it I'd say, like if I was having if I walk to the class just feeling dreadful, I would just call someone.\nMy mom or a friend.\nNot to talk about necessarily like oh wow, I'm having an awful day.\nBut just to like have a conversation, say like, \"I'm not doing well right now.\nHow is the weather in California?\" or something just to take my immediate mindset off of, you know, I just sat through a class where I was just having a migraine.\nIf you are the caregiver or loved one on the other end of one of those phone calls, it's critical you help the patient set realistic expectations for their recovery.\nThe best way that parents and caregivers and family members can help support their loved one through the transition back to school is to educate themselves.\nLearn as much as you can about concussion, understand concussion, go online.\nThere's a lot of information.\nAgain, a quick Google search could pull up some basic screenings that they can do to identify is the student experiencing some issues?\nThey might have had previous depression and anxiety that is now exacerbated after their concussion, but we really try to get students back to school so that they can be in the environment with their friends.\nAnd we find that it's so important to tell students from both their parents and the school side, hit them with the message of, we we don't expect this to last long.\nWe are here to support you if it does last longer than a typical concussion, and there are things that we can do, you know, you won't be alone through this.\nManaging return to learn for students is a process that needs to be adapted based on their age and activities they're involved in.\nSo elementary school is different.\nI think elementary school is much easier to manage because usually students have like one or two teachers and the demands that are placed on them for thinking are a lot less than a high school student or a college student.\nSo elementary students tend to be easier to manage, but you have to think about when you're when you're talking to them about their symptoms, you don't want to say are you nauseous, are you fatigued?\nBecause they don't might not know what that means.\nSo you want to say things like um, like our documents that we use with elementary schools, we gear them and say, you know, \"How does your how does your tummy feel or do you feel wobbly when you move your head or uh back to back and forth?\" So we ask them questions that are age appropriate.\nHigh school students, I feel the hardest students to manage are like 10th and 11th graders because so many of them are high achieving.\nThey are pulled from their sports that they don't want to be pulled from.\nAll they want to do is get back, and they want to push through their symptoms.\nThey don't want to stop.\nThey don't want accommodated.\nThey don't want to do anything.\nThey want to return to normal and keep pushing through.\nReturning to college with a concussion also comes with its own unique challenges.\nLetting those in your social and academic circles know what you're going through is key.\nCollege students are really, they have a hard time when they have concussions because harder than any other age of children, teenagers because college students have such pressure on them at college.\nThe academic load is heavy.\nOften they struggle with their symptoms after a concussion.\nEvery college has a disability support office.\nSo my recommendation is always reach out to the disability support office on campus.\nLet them know you've had a concussion.\nProvide them with any medical documentation that you might have.\nSome schools are better than others about this when working with concussions.\nBut the schools, the universities who are um who've had training in concussion and understand it, their disability support office will often help the student with academic accommodations for their classes with their professors.\nIf you don't want to go that route, at least let your professor know what has happened.\nMost professors are understanding.\nLike your teachers really want you most teachers really, really want you to do well in their your class.\nAnd your boss needs you to do well to um for you to be a good employee and for him to get his work done.\nSo they are much more forgiving when you say, I too want to get my work done and this is how I'm going to do it.\nIt's just going to be a little different.\nSo I think both the teachers and your your bosses are really rooting for you to get your work done.\nAnd so how it's going to happen might have to change and I think people will be flexible.\nBut I I first and foremost had to say, I can finish this work just not in the given hours that I used to do it.\nAnd having that conversation where I was like, I will still complete all tasks assigned for me on Monday by the following Monday but that might require me to do two hours on Tuesday because I have, you know, two classes on Tuesday but on Thursday I have no classes so I can get four hours in.\nAnd just having that time having that reassuring him that I will still complete all the tasks I need to um just at a different time scale than I had in the past was really important because if I didn't like assure him of that then, you know, I my job is at risk.\nWhen I worked in consulting and was the employee dealing with concussion symptoms myself, I had to be upfront and honest with my employers and let them know that I couldn't work nine to five and a 40 hour work week at the same level I could before.\nWe came to an agreement that I would only be paid hourly and only had to work the hours I felt good enough to work.\nAnd it was the best choice for me and the best choice for the company and soon enough, I was able to scale back up to a full-time position.\nAnd while Juliana was upfront with her employer and her professors, she wishes she had shown that same transparency to her friends during the recovery process.\nSo if I could go back, I think I would really try to tell my friends how they could help me because, you know, none of them have gone through this.\nSo I wish I could go back and say, \"I'm if I'm having a migraine, just like give me a hand to squeeze because it really hurts.\" or if I had a bad exam, don't tell me, oh you can just blame it on your concussion because that's not what I want to hear.\nSo having that conversation with them and saying like these are things that will help me when in those moments would be something I would wish I could go back and do because I really didn't communicate too much about my injury.\nI told you I brought my phone around but it wasn't to talk about my head it was to, you know, distract myself.\nSo would recommend informing people around you how they could help you.\nThe ups and downs of Juliana's experience back in the classroom after her concussion, shows the importance of seeking care immediately and working with your doctors on an individualized plan.\nBut in general, Dr. Egan Johnson likes to tackle the return to learn process in four week chunks.\nThe first four weeks, we want the schools to to not over support them, but to support them more than they normally would moving forward beyond four weeks.\nOnce a student has gone beyond four weeks, start introducing things back in.\nStart introducing um more work, more repetition.\nIf a student hits that four week mark and still seems to be crashing every day, it's a good time to check back in with their provider and support team at school to explore other resources and strategies.\nYou want to find out, is the student, what symptoms are they still having?\nIf a student tells me that they are having headaches, I want to know in what environment.\nYou want to drill down to try to figure out, are they having headaches because just they're getting headaches now or is it because it's afternoon and they're exhausted?\nOr is it because they might have an ocular vestibular issue going on that's making the lines jump around for them when they read?\nAnd one thing that I often identify in students is suddenly they'll be tracking when they read with their finger.\nAnd I say, have you always done that?\nNo, but it's easier for me now to read if I do that.\nWell, that could signify that there's something going on um you know, that's making them feel off balance maybe, making their eyes.\nThey could have a convergence insufficiency issue.\nA lot of students who haven't recovered may need to be evaluated by a concussion clinic for not only vestibular therapy but cognitive rehabilitation therapy and that's different than cognitive behavioral therapy.\nCognitive rehab rehabilitation therapy is more um focused on executive functions.\nSo short-term memory, speed of processing, organization.\nSo there are therapies available to help students, but at the school level, talk to the school.\nIf you're a parent, talk to the school, \"My child still hasn't recovered.\nMy child's still struggling with homework, my child,\" let them know everything.\nAnd then there are options legal options educationally such as a 504 plan is something commonly recommended for students who are struggling and have a substantial impact and the key there for a 504 plan which provides a student with academic accommodations is, they have to be the concussion has to be substantially impacting a major life function.\nThat could be thinking, reading, concentrating, sleeping, and schools know what 504 plans are.\nA student may need something more significant.\nSo on down the road if maybe a student's concussion hasn't recovered and it's been three months, six months later.\nIf they are substantially struggling in school, it may be important for them to be evaluated for possibly special education.\nNow, I have never in all my years to date, I've never seen a student with just one concussion in their whole history need special education services because of that one concussion.\nHowever, I have seen it frequently with students who have multiple concussions.\nIt didn't happen overnight, but Juliana eventually got to a point where her symptoms weren't dominating her every thought and move.\nI think I didn't recognize I was feeling better at all until I was feeling significantly better and then I looked back and realized, wow, a week ago I was feeling actually x amount better than I was the week before.\nSo, but when I was finally able, finally feeling close to normal, I realized that I was not bothered when I had my headphones out for a period of time or I was just went to multiple classes and then went to work and then I I got home and I realized, wow I did all that and like patted myself on the back because it wasn't a moment where I I woke up and I was like, today is the day that I feel great.\nIt was more I would finish the day feeling better and realizing that I had made it through more tasks I had today than the day before and that kind of continued until I was really back to where I was.\nYou can get there too and just remember, concussion recovery does not happen in a straight line.\nThe ups and downs are normal.\nA lot of people think that concussion is a you'll see a lot of step-by-step.\nFirst you do step one, then you do step two.\nBut what you're not hearing is that it's not a linear process.\nSometimes you take a step forward and you go two steps back.\nSo for some students, it is going to take them longer to recover.\nThey may be a week in and suddenly be experiencing tons more symptoms.\nSo, you know, you just have to kind of go with the flow, have open communication with your school, open communication with your healthcare provider.\nWith the benefit of hindsight, Juliana knows how she would have handled things differently and she hopes you'll learn from her missteps.\nI really wish looking back that I could tell myself on that Monday after I saw the school nurse, that you need to take a week off right now.\nAnd I know that if I had done the five days of, you know, relaxing at home and ordering food and not going to the store, I really think my recovery would have been significantly quicker or my symptoms would not have gotten as, you know, bad as they did.\nI really believe that and I wish someone had really sat me down and said, no, you're not going to class today.\nSo, if you are the person, um, sit yourself down and don't do it.\nIf you are the loved one of a person, they're going to probably push back against you but really it's for their health or your own health, whichever the situation is.\nSo no one really ever told me and I really think is incredibly powerful is how you will alarm like surprise yourself with how strong you were to get through it and do everything um because you think of you making it to one class out of four as as that might be like a failure, but you made it to one class with a concussion while everybody else there was just doing it because on a day-to-day basis.\nSo I think I walked away from my recovery feeling like I could take on more things than I had before because heck if I can do organic chemistry with a head injury then I can do anything, right?\nLike I I can get through a lot more.\nSo I think, you know, that's the best thing.\nI walked away so much more confident in myself and my ability to be, you know, persistent and like tenacious.\nIt's so true.\nLife is hard enough, but just getting through the day to day with a concussion deserves tremendous kudos.\nWe are stronger and more resilient than we can ever give ourselves credit for.\nA huge thank you to Dr. Brenda Egan Johnson and Juliana Calia for sharing their tremendous wisdom in this episode of Concussion Game Plan.\nIf you have more questions about returning to learn after concussion or want to get more involved with us at CLF, check us

episode, we're focusing on return to play.\nHear from Dr. Barry Jordan about the safest way to get back to your sport.\nPlus, beach volleyball national champion Julia Scoles shares a cautionary tale about what can happen when you don't follow concussion protocols.\nShe has a hopeful message we can all feel inspired by.\nUntil then, I'm Dr. Chris Nowinski.\nKeep fighting.\n\nEP7: Return to Play w/ Dr. Barry Jordan and Julia Scoles\n\nHey everyone, it's Dr. Chris Nowinski, co-founder and CEO of the Concussion Legacy Foundation. Welcome to the final episode of season one of the Concussion Game Plan podcast. So far, we've broken down all aspects of a concussion. It's symptoms, treatments, return to school and work, and for athletes returning to sports. Today, we're answering the question, what if my symptoms aren't improving? What happens if you're a month out from your injury and still feeling sick? Will I ever feel like myself again? There's nobody better to explain how to manage persistent concussion symptoms or post concussion syndrome than CLF co-founder and medical director, Dr. Robert Cantu. We're excited to welcome him back to guide us through what can be a difficult and scary diagnosis. Post concussion syndrome is really defined as persistent concussion symptoms. In other words, after a concussion, there are 26 symptoms that we look for. If those symptoms don't clear up within the first three to four weeks, especially beyond a month, we refer to those persistent concussion symptoms as post concussion syndrome. Dr. Cantu is one of the world's leading experts in treating post-concussion syndrome or PCS. He has seen patients of all ages from many different backgrounds who struggle with lingering symptoms for months or even years after their concussion. He was the doctor I saw when I was at my lowest point with PCS. Esther Lovett of Cambridge Massachusetts also sought out his care after her concussion. I'd say the worst really throughout has been the headaches. It was just a huge like amount of pressure in your head. And I would feel it in my face too, where it felt like my nose was broken, like my cheeks were broken, like it it was just such an intense not only pressure in the head, but in the face too, my whole neck, just a very very all-consuming headache I guess. Just unlike any headaches that I had experienced before. Esther, a former CLF intern, is now a senior at Georgetown University. She suffered six diagnosed concussions and many more she believes went undiagnosed during her middle and high school days playing soccer and hockey. She developed post concussion syndrome after her first major concussion during a soccer game in eighth grade when the ball hit her in the back of the head. I think it definitely felt different than previous concussions or, you know, previous hits I'd taken in soccer. I was immediately pretty dizzy and I just remember being kind of confused, you know, even about like, you know, which side of the field we were playing and and stuff like that. And I think going into it, I felt like I had been well educated about concussions on my club soccer team. You know, the coach had always talked about concussions. I had teammates who had had concussions. I had previously had a diagnosed concussion where I had symptoms for a few days and then felt completely back to normal. So, you know, missed one game and came back and to me that seemed like the normal trajectory from what I had experienced and from what I had seen other teammates go through. So that was really my expectation going in and so as the symptoms were a lot more severe than what I had experienced before and I didn't feel myself getting better in a few days or even in a few weeks, I think that was very worrisome just because the sort of one week turnaround time was really the only explanation that I had heard about concussion, that it was extremely temporary. If you don't notice your symptoms improving in the first month after your concussion, and especially if they're getting worse, it's important to find a provider who specializes in treating concussion patients, like Dr. Cantu, to evaluate you. The criteria that you use to diagnose somebody with post concussion syndrome is first of all, the post concussion syndrome checklist. The listing of the cognitive symptoms, the somatic symptoms, the vestibular ocular symptoms, the sleep symptoms, and the emotional symptoms, ranking how many there are and what their severity is. In addition to that, a neurologic examination is undertaken, and a neurologic history is always done before that exam. In the history, we look for uh conditions that would predict that a concussion might last longer than expected and go into post-concussion syndrome. Conditions such as learning disabilities including ADD, ADHD, or seizure disorders or individuals with emotional problems such as depression or anxiety or panic attacks or migraine headaches. These are all conditions which if you have them prior to your concussion doesn't mean you're going to get post concussion syndrome, but it means you are more prone to get it than you would otherwise. And then finally, the neurologic exam focuses heavily on cognitive uh difficulties, difficulties with memory, especially new learning, and difficulties with uh balance and and eye tracking and difficulties uh as well that show up on the symptom checklist. I think early on, the dizziness was really bad, the confusion. I also had a lot of ocular symptoms that were unresolved for a while, but I remember even just a few days when I was being kept home from school, um with that concussion, I went to the library to get audiobooks because they told me to listen to audio books. And I took some out and I realized that I couldn't read the description of any of them on the back. Like my vision was so blurry. I couldn't focus on any of the words. And I was so like rattled by that that I didn't even want to say anything. So I just took some just checked out some random ones because I didn't even want to say really. I was there with my mom that I couldn't even read the back of the books. I think my memory was also a tough one where I just felt like I couldn't really remember anything and I think that's also that's a scary symptom I think, feeling like you've either lost memory of things or that you struggle now to um remember things and you know, I was still in school and so that seemed particularly like a big deal to be trying to go back to school and feeling like I can't even remember what what's happening. If you can relate to the struggles Esther describes, there's good news. There are therapies out there to help treat your PCS symptoms. But first, you have to work with your doctor to identify which category of symptoms you have. The most common domains of symptoms are cognitive symptoms where things like being foggy or things like being confused, or things like difficulty with concentration or difficulty focusing at screens, or difficulty learning new information or having to take a greater amount of time to to learn something or figure out a problem. If your symptoms are predominantly in the cognitive domain basket so to speak, then cognitive therapy is what you're going to be recommended to have and that therapy is going to be a certain amount of exercises and memory exercises. But the most important thing are going to be learning cognitive skills, different ways to retain information better and also work on building cognitive endurance, being able to be at screens for longer periods of time. If your symptoms are falling into the sleep category and the problems are predominantly difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, then discussions about naturally occurring substances that help this like melatonin, or whether or not prescribing something for sleep is appropriate would be something that should be followed up on. On the other hand, if your symptoms are predominantly in the emotional category, if it's predominantly anxiety or depression or irritability or emotionality, then this is something that should be worked out with a counselor and if necessary, a psychiatrist and consideration for particular forms of of psychotherapy. For instance, cognitive behavioral therapy might be considered in this group. On the other hand, if your symptoms are predominantly in the vestibular ocular area, so that balance is an issue, dizziness is an issue, eye tracking produces blurred vision or lightheadedness or unsteadiness. Then the referral and the therapy that would be appropriate would be vestibular therapy for the balance part and ocular therapy for the eye tracking abnormalities. I had never heard of vestibular therapy before and really didn't know that those sorts of symptoms were part of concussion. It it helped me in a lot of ways and I think that was that's still one of the treatments that helped me the most overall. When I went to see the physical therapist, she found that I had a pretty severe convergence insufficiency, so I was seeing double way too far away. And that was something that we were able to work on. Um we used literally had like a popsicle stick with a smiley face sticker that I would bring in and try to keep both eyes on it. But you could see she would video my eyes so I could see and and one of them would just give up and you could see it flip out and stop focusing completely. Um but that was something that we were able to work on. I worked on at home and were able to get that back, you know, well in the range of normal again. Also helped with some of the dizziness symptoms as well and with balance. Another big thing was like moving my neck at the same time that my eyes were moving and having them move differently from one another. Um also focusing on one thing with like a busy background. So all of those really helped a lot with my symptoms and with sort of the dizziness and and with balance as well. So I think that that helped a lot and just I could feel even with the the convergence that it made my headaches better, with, you know, reading and focusing on a screen or slides in school. So that's always great with any treatment where you feel like wow, I can feel this working and I can feel the difference when I'm at school or when I'm reading at home. I did a lot of work on my neck as well. I had some whiplash from the injury that I also didn't really think about. You're so focused on your head and your brain that you're not really thinking about your neck very much. But I know a lot of people experience symptoms that really originate from their neck too. So that was something I did in PT. I also got, like I saw a sports masseuse to work on my neck. I did acupuncture for that which helped a lot. Um I saw a chiropractor to help with my neck as well. Um and I think sort of sorting out my neck, I definitely felt a difference in my symptoms as well. It can be difficult juggling different therapy appointments with school and work, especially when you're symptomatic, but don't give up. When you finally find the right treatment for you, it can make a world of difference. And it felt like, well, I already feel like I need, you know, more time to do schoolwork because I have headaches sometimes and, you know, need to take a rest after school and so sometimes it felt like, is this all really worth it? And like if I'm not feeling immediate relief from going to something, like is it worth it to keep going? And there were certainly therapies that I tried that didn't work for me and that, you know, I did end up not continuing to go or even meeting with certain doctors that you just didn't vibe with or that you didn't see being helpful to you. It can definitely be frustrating and you'll have some um disappointing experiences, but I think you'll definitely find things that work and it unfortunately is some trial and error because different things work for different people, but I think those can be really helpful in isolating sometimes where the symptoms are coming from. The therapies that would be directed toward the domains of symptoms, sometimes don't immediately have beneficial effect and take some time. Generally speaking, most of them that are showing positive effect are going to be sustained for six to eight weeks at least in terms of with a therapist and then one on their own may be doing those therapies indefinitely until the symptoms have totally cleared at home. Most of the therapies are not expected to cause symptoms to get worse while you're doing them, but rather to alleviate them. The one exception to that are the vestibular ocular symptoms. Especially the balance symptoms which can actually be made worse while doing and immediately after the exercises and it's trying to desensitize the brain to those symptoms. I really think that you can find something that works for you and it may not be the first thing that you try or the second or the third. The concussion doctor that I saw for a long time, like I would try things that wouldn't work and he would come back and he's like, all right, let's uh go back to our toolbox. So I think there's a lot of tools in the toolbox and um, you know, depending on your symptoms and exactly your situation, not all of them are going to work for you. But I think it's definitely worth it to try them and I think you'll find you'll definitely find something that works for you and that's going to help and there unfortunately has to be some trial and error because it's such an individual injury and recovery and your own response to it. But I think it is it is really worth the time and the effort to go through that and just figure out what works and then stick with that.

You might have a few good weeks followed by a few bad days. It can be very defeating. It can start to feel like it's your fault or everything is in your head. But know that what you're experiencing is normal. The setbacks are hard and I think there are still times where I feel like, you know, where you have more symptoms and that's still frustrating. But I think just looking, taking time to to reflect too on how far you've come and and what this looks like over several weeks or months or years, wherever you are in your recovery, um can be really helpful for that perspective and just to feel like you are seeing progress overall even on those days where, you know, maybe there's a little bit of a dip or a plateau. For anybody that's been told that PCS is not a real condition, uh I would argue and and tell them that they've just not heard correct advice. The reality is, when you hurt your knee, the pain may last for a very long period of time. The brain is incredibly more complex than your knee, comprising billions of nerve cell with trillions of connections. So it's not a surprise that in some instances, you have symptoms that last for a very long period of time. I think I definitely definitely felt like a different person. I think the fatigue, I felt that as well. Like I had always been very active and played sports and just to be so profoundly tired and just feeling like no matter how much you slept, you were still exhausted. And I think I mean that did start to get better. I think that was the worst in, you know, the pretty acute phases, but that was very that was very unlike me and I think that was one of the things certainly that my parents noticed in thinking, you know, maybe this is more serious than than we initially thought. And just feeling really cognitively drained. Like I was, you know, I was listening to audio books, but even just listening to something felt very effortful or playing solitaire felt like a huge effort to do. I think for a parent or a caring caregiver, it's a particularly difficult situation uh to be taking care of somebody with persistent PCS. I think what's most important is to understand that it's a real condition. This is not somebody that's not wanting to get better as soon as they can and most importantly to realize that almost certainly they will get better over time. Though it may not be nearly as quickly as either the individual or their caregiver would like. I think support from my parents has been hugely important for me. Like my mom has been so supportive, came to every appointment. She's really on top of everything from, you know, typing papers for me that I dictated to her because I was too sensitive to look at the computer, you know, to doing a ton of research to make sure that I got the best care possible. That's really meant the world. I think with my dad, he's been a lifelong athlete and you know, he was always the one taking me to my soccer tournaments or hockey games when I played and sports were sort of our thing. So he was definitely the one that I was more worried about disappointing, I guess. I'm not being able to play sports anymore, but he never once pushed me to go back to sports at all and, you know, has been just as happy to watch me play golf recreationally very poorly. Individuals that are going through prolonged PCS provide a very difficult emotional situation for both themselves as well as their caregivers, their family. But it's extremely important that families are supportive and not questioning of the individual. This is a very real condition. Their lives are turned upside down in a negative way by the condition. They don't want to have this condition. And to the extent caregivers can provide emotional support, it is extremely beneficial. Also, it's extremely imp\n\nEP8: What if your symmptons don't go away w/ Dr. Robert Cantu and Esther Lovett\n\nEP3: Physical Symptoms of Concussion Pt. 2 w/ Dr. David Dodick and Carla Ciccone\n\nHello, it's Dr. Chris Nowinski, co-founder and CEO of the Concussion Legacy Foundation. Welcome to episode three of the Concussion Game Plan podcast and part two of our conversation with Dr. David Dodick and Carla Ciaccone focused on the physical symptoms of concussion. We want to jump back in starting with a look at visual symptoms after concussion. We know visual impairment and dysfunction is common after concussion, and symptoms can be painful and disorienting.\nIt was the type of feeling where, like, if you looked at your computer screen for like 48 hours straight without stopping, and you got like the worst eye strain of your life, just your eyes are exhausted. You know, they all you want to do is shut them for a little bit of relief and you can't. That it just and it felt like there's like a headache in your eyes, like in the back of your eyes.\nA headache in the back of your eyes is a great way of describing it. Carla Ciaccone is a Toronto based writer who suffered a concussion after a waiter carrying a tray of plates slammed into the back of her head at a restaurant. Dr. David Dodick, a professor of neurology who runs the Concussion Clinic at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona tells us patients often report having blurred vision and trouble focusing.\nWhen they say, I can't, I can't sit in a car, because as things start going by me, I get dizzy, that could be a visual problem. Or they say, you know, when I walk down a grocery aisle, I get dizzy and disoriented, that could be a visual problem. And then sometimes they just can't quite track things in their visual world. So that's something they complain about. Sometimes they complain of actual frank double vision, where they see two things either side by side or two things you know, on top of one another. That's not terribly common, but but it can occur. So it's important when someone says, there's something wrong with my vision to figure out exactly again, what it is they mean by that, because the treatment for it is going to depend on where the problem is. You know, the thing about concussion is that it's an injury that can affect different areas of the brain in different people. And the thing about vision and the thing about ocular motility, and the fact that we take for granted when I look up, look down, look side to side, I don't even think about that because it happens so easily and spontaneously. But that's very complicated anatomy. And the anatomy of vision and the anatomy of eye movements is distributed throughout the brain. And what I mean by that is, at least half of the brain's pathways, and we're talking about 200 billion cells, each of which make 10,000 connections to 10,000 other cells. It's really complicated. But more than half of those brain pathways are dedicated to vision and eye movement. That's profound. What that means is that it's almost impossible to place an injury in anyone location of the brain or brainstem without affecting vision and eye movements. And that's why vision is so commonly affected after concussion.\nTo treat these complex vision symptoms, it's important to find the right type of specialist.\nThe help that you need may come not even from necessarily an eye doctor. I mean, it's obvious to think that if I have a problem with my vision, I'm going to go to an eye doctor. But when you go to an eye doctor, they do what they do and they do it very well, and they they look in the back of your eyes and they see that the eye itself looks healthy. And your vision looks your visual acuity looks normal. You got 2020 vision and your eyes look healthy. That doesn't solve the problem. And so you really need to be seen by either a neuro ophthalmologist who has expertise in this area, or a concussion program where they have therapists and experts in the the you know, the vision and ocular motor system who can initiate exercises. Sometimes they'll put prisms in your lenses and things like that. So sometimes there are techniques and tricks like that that they can use. But oftentimes it comes down to training the visual system to adapt to the injury and to overcome. And in the vast majority of cases, that happens. It may not happen overnight, but it happens over days or weeks. But usually, the the visual symptom is something that's you can rehabilitate. But it's it's you have to pressure test the system by doing certain exercises and visual therapies that actually enhances and facilitates and speeds up that adaptation that would normally occur in the brain anyway. You're just trying to to move it along. Sometimes these visual exercises and visual therapies are not fun because they can cause you to be dizzy. They can make your headache worse. They can cause you to feel nauseated and imbalance. And it's like, wow, I feel 10 times worse after doing that. But it it is important to sort of push through it, because you force your brain to adapt to the injury. And not to the point where you're debilitated by your symptoms, but it's perseverance and persistence is important. So, recognize the fact that you might feel a little bit worse when you first start out start out with some of these visual exercises and visual therapies, but know that, you know, relief is around the corner. Your brain will adapt and you will recover and improve from this.\nFor Carla, recovery was all about learning the balance of positively stimulating her brain without pushing things too hard or putting too much pressure on herself.\nThere were days that I tried to just go back to my normal routine or go back to working on my computer because I just it was that's what I do and I I just really wanted to to get better and and you you want to test the waters of how bad am I? Like, let me just see. And when I did that, it does just set you back so much farther. You I would wake up the next day or even just immediately like have to go lay down because I had made my headache that much worse by staring at a screen. And I'm admittedly not a sporty person, but definitely if I um pushed my body beyond its its limits, you know, you you I got a physical reminder right away of why I was supposed to be resting. You know, headaches got worse, vision got blurrier, and it just it it makes your recovery that much longer. And I think that was a scary part for me because I noticed right away when I would try to push myself that that I would get that much worse right after.\nI wish I would have known that it's okay. It's okay to not feel okay and it's okay to not know exactly when this this is going to wrap up and I'm and I'm going to feel better again or back to my old self. And that it's a process. Like it's a it's a process of talking about what's going on, more than you're probably comfortable with. I know you're supposed to be able to tell your doctors anything or you technically you should, but sometimes it's not comfortable to tell your doctor, you know, my concussion has made my thoughts turn dark and and I'm really depressed. And those things don't don't come naturally to us sometimes. So I would have told myself to just relax about that. Talk to as many people as possible, advocate for yourself and just be patient with yourself, and go really easy on yourself. Treat yourself like you would treat like a little baby that you were taking care of, and pretend that you are that little baby. It's like it's a weird way to think of it, but really like when you're when your brain gets hurt, you're kind of back to square one and you really need to nurture yourself as much as you can.\nBeing kind and understanding with yourself throughout the healing process is key. And for parents and caregivers, your love, support, and compassion can have a direct impact on how your loved one recovers.\nIf I'm if I'm talking to a parent or someone who's supporting someone with concussion. First of all, it's an understanding and an empathy that this is real. It's biology, not psychology. And although you can't see it, feel it or touch it, what they're telling you and what their experience is absolutely real. And it's not due to, you know, stress or anxiety or some other psychological problem that this is often attributed to. This is a traumatic brain injury. And many of the symptoms that people experience including anxiety and depression are related to the injury itself. To some extent, from the devastation that devastating impact that it has had on their life, but also as a manifestation, as a symptomatic manifestation of the disease of the injury itself. So empathy and understanding that what they're telling you is absolutely real. Number two, don't accept any explanation to the contrary. So if you're seeing a healthcare provider who tries to chalk this up to just stress or depression or some other mood disorder, don't accept it. Find somebody who has expertise, who understands the injury, and is used to looking after people who have post-concussion symptoms. So, find the right person and don't give up until you've found the right person or the right team to care for you, because the the better and the more aggressively this is this is managed up front, the less likely it is that you're going to be susceptible to the next one, and the less likely it is that your life is going to be impacted long term from this. So, help them find the help that they need. And and don't accept no for an answer and don't if it doesn't sound right to you, listen to your gut instinct, listen to yourself.\nGreat message there from Dr. Dodick. We'll be right back.\nIf you need help finding the right doctor or the right team to treat your concussion and post-concussion syndrome, we're here for you. The CLF helpline provides free, personalized support to those struggling with the outcomes of brain injury. The helpline also has a mentorship program that connects those suffering with a peer support volunteer who has had similar experiences as a patient or caregiver. Submit a request today at concussionfoundation.org/helpline and a dedicated member of the Concussion Legacy Foundation team will be in touch with you as soon as possible.\nTwo of the most common concussion symptoms we haven't touched on yet are the ones that make it hardest to live a normal life after concussion, light and noise sensitivity.\nSo imagine if you were being interrogated and someone was just, you know, how obnoxious it is and offensive it is to have a light shine in your eyes, you immediately want to move away, right? And avoid that. Imagine if you were in a car, and you had a really good sound system and you just cranked it up to the very, you know, as high as it could go. You can't take that for very long, right? So it's like, you know, the volume of both sound and light has been turned up significantly even though nobody's adjusted the light and nobody's adjusted the noise. So that's what sound and light sensitivity can feel like for people. And you can imagine if someone's having both light and sound sensitivity, it's hard to be in the world, right? Because there are lights everywhere and there is sound everywhere. And so you want to just there's a reason why people retreat to a quote quiet, dark room, because the light and sound is so, not only obnoxious, but actually it exacerbates all the other symptoms. So exposure to light and sound, not only is offensive, but it amplifies the headache, it amplifies the dizziness and it amplifies the nausea, and it amplifies the imbalance. And why is that? Because the brain is so interconnected. We have what we call sensory integration centers in the brain. So if I have pain in my head, whether it's from a head injury or I have a migraine headache, or I have meningitis, or I've just had a ruptured aneurism, the first thing that's going to happen is I'm going to have severe pain in my head. The next thing that's going to happen is I'm going to be sensitive to light and sound, and I'm going to be nauseated. Why? These networks are interconnected. And once you once you upset one area in the brain, immediately it's talking to other areas in the brain. So, when you have pain in your brain, the first thing it starts doing is it starts talking to all these sensory integration networks so that normal movement becomes is perceived as unsteadiness. Normal light is perceived as a spotlight in the eye, and normal sound is perceived as like a gunshot. Everything is louder, um noisier, brighter. Even smells can be more offensive, right? I can smell something 10 miles away. The sensory environment is turned up. And it's very hard to function in in a world like that. It's due to the functional connectivity between these areas of the brain. Sometimes wearing sunglasses can help. Sometimes there are special type of lenses. They're called FL41 lenses that can actually filter out the most offensive spectrums of light in the light spectrum. So it might it might filter out red light or yellow light or white light, for example. Often times treating headache can actually make sound and light sensitivity much better. So if I treat headache, and I treat the visual system, and I treat the vestibular system effectively, then all of a sudden, all the other symptoms start to die down and dampen and down, right? So light is now less offensive, and and sound the light and sound sensitivity isn't as prominent. So, trying to avoid situations where there's bright light and sound, maybe using certain types of lenses that can help. But ultimately, it's treating the other problems. It's very seldom do I see people who just come in and say, doc, I can't stand the light. That's the only problem I have is I just can't stand the light. It's never like that.\nThe last physical symptom we'll touch on today is sleep. Concussion can affect our sleep in many ways.\nSome people become what we call hypersomnolent. They always want to sleep. They can't get enough sleep. Other people can't get to sleep, so they become, you know, insomniacs. So sleep disruption is common and it can be different in different individuals. It occurs because the anatomy that controls sleep and the the biochemistry in the brain that controls sleep is tightly regulated. And if you disrupt those areas, if you disrupt brain chemistry and if you disrupt disrupt the anatomy of the brain, you can obviously disrupt the normal circadian rhythms and the normal anatomy and biochemistry that controls sleep wake cycles. So that's that's why it occurs. And some of the areas of the brain that are affected by concussion happen to be areas that are intimately involved in the control and regulation of sleep wake cycles.\nThe first thing that people can do about it is to try to avoid factors that can amplify the the problem. So, if you're having trouble getting to sleep and staying asleep, then, you know, avoiding things like a lot of caffeine can can be helpful. Taking things that are relatively natural that can help you sleep, like melatonin, for example, could be helpful. Melatonin is something that's gotten a lot of interest recently because it has anti-inflammatory properties, and it seems perhaps maybe neuro protective after concussion and it helps sleep. So melatonin could could be helpful as a over-the-counter preparation that could actually help you sleep. The other thing is that all of these other symptoms that you're experiencing could be making it difficult for you to sleep. So headache for example. If you have a severe headache and you're nauseated, it's very difficult to sleep. It's difficult to get to sleep, it's difficult to stay asleep. So managing these other symptoms can be can be effective in helping you get to sleep and stay asleep.\nKeeping regular sleep wake schedules. Yeah, it's very tempting uh to have a nap today. But, you know, I'm going to try to stay awake and go to bed and try to wake up at the same times even though that may be difficult. Um, it's I think it's important. So sleep hygiene. That type of sleep hygiene approach is important.\nCaregivers who know their loved one is struggling with sleep can play an important role in making sure they practice good sleep hygiene.\nEncouragement. You know, encouragement. If if people do the sorts of things that I said, and, you know, when you go into the bedroom, um there's no cell phone, there's no laptop, there's no computer, there's no television. So you're in bed to sleep. You maintain normal sleep and wake cycles. You avoid things that can make it worse like caffeine, uh late night snacks, things like that. You take, you know, supplemental melatonin or things like that that can help with sleep, you manage other symptoms. I think it's just again, just an awareness that the right environment is necessary to help someone sleep. Relaxation therapy, stress management. These things are also helpful for sleep. Cognitive behavioral therapy. So all of these things if if you write down the list and keep continue to try to encourage, because sometimes if you have a high school son or daughter at home and, you know, they're used to going to bed late, waking up late, they've got their phone in bed with them, they're snacking in bed, they're talking to their friends or texting their friends. All of these things, while it seems like that they're going to do more of that if they can't get to sleep, it becomes paramount to stop that for a period of time until you re-establish some normality and you get over that period of acute post-concussion symptoms. I guess if I were a parent, I would say, look, it's short term pain for long term gain here, yeah? You we can't continue to operate like you've been before you were concussed. So, for the next two to three weeks, we have to strict to the schedule because then you can get back to your normal life. But if we don't, this can linger and can persist and make like much more difficult long term. So short term short term pain for long term gain.\nWe like to end each episode with a big dose of hope. If you're listening right now and struggling with any of the symptoms we've touched on today or others, please know that you will get better and you are not alone. Carla recommends doing everything you can to find community.\nWhen you're dealing with the symptoms of a concussion and you're alone, being alone with your thoughts and headaches and whatever else you're experiencing can really get you to a dark place rather quickly, and it's really important to seek help from your community, from your doctors, from from whoever you can, because having having other people around is really what what helped me. And um advocating for myself to my doctors. I was very hesitant to to do anything. I it took me getting to a very, very low point to even seek out treatment at all. But it really was for me making tiny baby steps and doing new things in a in a safe and slow way that kind of that led to me eventually starting to heal and get better. And a big, big part of that was was talking to people, talking to different doctors, talking to friends. Even I talked to a couple of strangers who had been through concussions before, just just to open yourself up as much as you can, not in, you know, it's scary at first, but to try to to do it and try to find safe spaces, doctors that you feel comfortable with, people that you know well, or that come recommended, so that it's can take some of the pressure off. But I think definitely seeking help and in community is even if you're an introvert, I'm a I'm an introvert by nature, and it did help me more than probably anything, because there's only so much you can do for yourself by yourself. I'm here to tell you that it does get better, just get through the day, do what you need to do to get to relax and get through each day.\nFor Dr. Dodick, it's all about the three P's. Patience, perseverance and positivity. Patience that you wish this would just go away tomorrow, but it may not. This is an injury that may take a little time to recover. And it's different for everybody. So your friend might have gotten over their concussion in two days. Two weeks down the road, you're still experiencing symptoms. It's different for everybody. So you need to have some patience. You need to be positive in that the vast majority of people get better. And then perseverance. And by that I mean, you have to stick with what's been recommended, but you also have to persevere in finding the right provider or the right care team. And that is crucial because it's difficult for people to get better on their own if they're not provided with the education, the support and the right sort of treatment approaches that's tailored specifically to their individual needs. And if you're not getting the respect and support and care that you think you should be getting, then you have to move on. You have to persevere. You have to find the right team and there are there are really excellent providers out there.\nA big thank you to Dr. David Dodick and Carla Ciaccone for joining us for both of our physical symptom episodes and thank you for listening in.
